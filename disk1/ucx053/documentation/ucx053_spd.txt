          PRODUCT NAME:   Compaq TCP/IP Services for OpenVMS Version 5.3  SPD
          46.46.15

          DESCRIPTION

          The Compaq TCP/IP Services for OpenVMS software product is the OpenVMS
          implementation of the industry-standard TCP/IP protocol suite and in-
          ternet services for OpenVMS Alpha and OpenVMS VAX systems.b The ker-
          nel software is ported from the Compaq Tru64 UNIX product, which is
          based on the Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) Versions 4.3 and 4.4,
          with enhancements from Compaq Computer Corporation.

          Internetworking with TCP/IP hides the hardware details of each indi-
          vidual network and allows computers to communicate independent of their
          physical network connections. Internetworking uses a uniform set of
          protocols to define behavior on an internet for all nodes using sup-
          ported network media. TCP/IP provides both a standard transport mech-
          anism and full-duplex, reliable, stream communication services for soft-
          ware applications.

          Network Interface Layer Support

          With support for multiple network interfaces for each physical net-
          work controller, the Compaq TCP/IP Services for OpenVMS software al-
          lows OpenVMS systems to connect to individual host computers on dif-
          ferent types of networks:

          o  Ethernet for IPv4 and IPv6

          o  Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI) for IPv4 and IPv6

          o  Token Ring for IPv4

          o  Asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) (Alpha systems only) for IPv4

          Individual host computers can also connect with other hosts or net-
          works over serial communications lines using either the Serial Line
          Internet Protocol (SLIP or CSLIP) or the Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP).

          Internet Layer Support

          The Compaq TCP/IP Services for OpenVMS product supports the follow-
          ing Internet layer protocols that work together to move data around
          the internet:

          o  Internet Protocol (IP) provides a connectionless packet delivery
             service for IPv4 and IPv6.



                                           2

 



          Compaq TCP/IP Services for OpenVMS Version 5.3         SPD 46.46.15


          o  Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) provides diagnostic func-
             tions and handles error and control messages for IPv4 and IPv6.

          o  Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) dynamically maps an IP address
             to a physical hardware address for IPv4.

          o  Neighbor Discovery discovers neighbors in the same link, dynami-
             cally detects routers, dynamically maps all IP addresses to a phys-
             ical hardware address for IPv6, and maintains information about the
             paths to active neighbors.

          o  Path MTU for TCP and UDP calculates the most efficient means of trans-
             porting data across a network.

          o  Classless Interdomain Routing (CIDR) reduces routing tables and makes
             more efficient use of the IP address space.

          o  IPv6 mobile correspondent node allows the OpenVMS host to commu-
             nicate with mobile nodes and other correspondent nodes.

          o  Routing protocols and routing daemons enable gateways to exchange
             current routing information about hosts and directly connected net-
             works. Supported protocols include:

             -  Routing Information Protocol (RIP) Version 1 (RFC 1058) and RIP
                Version 2 (RFC 1388) for IPv4, and RIPng (RFC 2080) for IPv6

             -  Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) Version 2 (RFC 1583)

             -  Exterior Gateway Protocol (EGP) (RFC 904)

             -  Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) (RFC 1163, RFC 1267)

             -  Router Discovery (RFC 1256) for IPv4

          The routing daemons ROUTED and GATED communicate with the kernel to
          add new routes or to delete or modify existing routes. The Enhanced
          Gateway Routing Daemon (GATED) is based on GateD Unicast Version 4.0.6,
          with advanced routing options.

          Transport Layer Support

          To provide either connection-oriented or connectionless data trans-
          mission between two hosts (local or remote), the Compaq TCP/IP Ser-
          vices for OpenVMS product supports both TCP and UDP protocols. These
          protocols form the bridge between the Application layer and the In-
          ternet layer:

          o  Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) provides reliable, connection-
             oriented, sequenced data transfers for applications that must guar-
             antee delivery of the data.

          o  User Datagram Protocol (UDP) provides fast, connectionless data trans-
             fers for applications that do not require delivery confirmation.

          This release supports the TCP Extensions for High Performance (RFC 1323),
          and the IETF Wireless TCP Standards for congestion on low-bandwidth
          high-delay wireless and satellite networks. The wireless TCP set of
          standards encompasses TCP Extensions for High Performance (RFC 1323),
          SACK (RFC 2018), and Path MTU Discovery for IPv4 (RFC 1191) and IPv6
          (RFC 1981).

          RFC 1323 includes support for PAWS (Protection Against Wrapped Sequence)
          numbers, which supplies time stamps on transactions to prevent wrapped
          sequence numbers and for TCP window scale, which provides window scale
          factors for TCP connections.

          RFC 2018 defines TCP selective acknowledgment options, supporting mul-
          tiple acknowledgment windows and allowing outstanding acknowledgments
          even if sequence numbers are not in order.

          Application Layer Support

          The Compaq TCP/IP Services for OpenVMS product supports numerous Ap-
          plication layer protocols that allow OpenVMS users to:

          o  Run software on remote systems

          o  Transfer data files between local and remote systems

          Compaq TCP/IP Services for OpenVMS Version 5.3         SPD 46.46.15


          o  Share remote system resources such as disk storage space and print-
             ers as if they were directly connected to the user's local system

          o  Send and receive electronic mail messages locally or across the world-
             wide Internet

          o  Provide consistent, reliable, and efficient network services to all
             users on the internet

          Remote Computing

          With TELNET, an OpenVMS user can log in to remote hosts in the net-
          work. The TELNET features include:

          o  Simultaneous multiple sessions

          o  IBM 3270 model terminal emulation (TN3270)

          o  Support for both OpenVMS style and UNIX style interfaces

          o  Support for window sizing (rows and columns) and location options

          o  Kerberos authentication

          The popular UNIX Remote commands, called R commands, let OpenVMS users
          work in accounts on remote internet hosts that are either UNIX or OpenVMS
          systems. The Compaq TCP/IP Services for OpenVMS software supports the
          RLOGIN, RSH, REXEC, and RMT/RCD commands.

          The FINGER utility enables users to obtain information about each user
          on local or remote systems. This information includes user name, ac-
          count name, and the program the user is running.

          The X Display Manager Control Protocol (XDMCP) allows display devices
          to request that the login server present a login screen.

          File Transfer

          OpenVMS users transfer data files between local and remote systems through
          the use of the following components:

          o  File Transfer Protocol (FTP) creates, deletes, and copies files and
             directories between hosts.

          o  Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP) transfers files using the UDP
             protocol and no authentication and is typically used during the boot-
             strap process of diskless systems.

          o  The remote copy (rcp) command copies files between the local host
             and a remote host or between two remote hosts.

          FTP supports OpenVMS Extended File Specifications (long file names,
          deep directories, and extended character sets) for ODS-5 disks.

          Resource Sharing

          The Compaq TCP/IP Services for OpenVMS software provides network print-
          ing services through the line printer/line printer daemon (LPR/LPD)
          and the TELNET print symbiont (TELNETSYM).

          o  LPD provides remote printing services for UNIX and OpenVMS client
             hosts through local and remote print queues. Once the system man-
             ager sets up the print queues, OpenVMS client users enter the DCL
             command PRINT, and UNIX client users enter the lpr command.

          LPD can be configured for clusterwide availability, providing load bal-
          ancing and automatic failover for LPD-controlled print queues on the
          OpenVMS host.

          o  TELNETSYM provides remote print services that enable the use of stan-
             dard OpenVMS printing features not available with LPR/LPD.

          Network File System

          The Network File System (NFS) server software allows NFS client users
          to gain transparent access to remote file services. With NFS, when a
          user accesses files and directories from a remote system, they appear
          to reside on the local system regardless of operating system, hard-
          ware type, or architectural differences between the local and remote
          systems. The PC-NFS daemon provides authentication services to PC-NFS
          clients.

          TCP/IP Services provides support for NFS Version 2 and Version 3 in
          the NFS server. The NFS client is limited to Version 2. The main ben-
          efit of NFS Version 3 is increased maximum file size-up to 1 terabyte
          for an OpenVMS file system and up to 4 gigabytes for a container file
          system.

          Performance gains may result from the improvements to file-size pro-
          cessing and the enhanced write performance that allows the NFS server
          to acknowledge a write operation before the files are actually writ-
          ten to disk. Afterward, the server's response to a commit message con-
          firms that the data has been written to disk.

          Compaq TCP/IP Services for OpenVMS Version 5.3         SPD 46.46.15


          The NFS server supports communication over both TCP and UDP. NFS over
          TCP allows file access over wide area links. The NFS client is lim-
          ited to UDP only.

          The NFS server and client support OpenVMS Extended File Specifications,
          including long file names, deep directories, and extended character
          sets on ODS-5 file structures.

          Electronic Mail

          With the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), OpenVMS users can send
          and receive electronic mail to and from local and remote hosts. The
          Compaq TCP/IP Services for OpenVMS implementation of SMTP uses the OpenVMS
          Mail facility, which automatically recognizes an SMTP host address in
          the format smith@widgets.com. SMTP provides support for SFF (Send From
          File) and outbound alias specification.

          Compaq TCP/IP Services for OpenVMS Version 5.3         SPD 46.46.15


          The following mail systems work with SMTP, providing reliable, server-
          based mail repositories for clients:

          o  Post Office Protocol (POP) server

          o  IMAP Mail server (Alpha systems only)

          Network Services

          With the following Compaq TCP/IP Services for OpenVMS management com-
          ponents, network and system managers can provide consistent, reliable,
          and efficient services to their users with minimal interruption:

          o  Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) Version 2 includes a mas-
             ter agent and subagents that allow the OpenVMS system to be man-
             aged by a management station on the network. This version includes
             the same features found in the Compaq Tru64 UNIX SNMPv2 implemen-
             tation, along with other improvements.

          o  Network Time Protocol (NTP) Version 4 provides a means to synchro-
             nize time and coordinate time distribution throughout a TCP/IP net-
             work. NTP provides accurate and dependable timekeeping for OpenVMS
             hosts on TCP/IP networks.

          o  Berkeley Internet Name Domain (BIND) is a distributed database sys-
             tem that distributes and manages host information so that hosts do
             not need to locally manage the address of every other host on the
             internet. The BIND 9 server (available on Alpha systems only) is
             based on the Internet Software Consortium's (ISC) BIND 9.2 imple-
             mentation. It includes dynamic updates and BIND server cluster failover,
             which allows multiple BIND master servers to share a common database,
             thus providing both redundancy and a failover mechanism when one
             of the servers becomes unavailable. The BIND resolver on both VAX
             and Alpha systems, and the BIND server on VAX systems, are based
             on the ISC's BIND 8.2.1 implementation.

          o  Load broker supplies cluster load balancing, round-robin schedul-
             ing, and automatic failover.

          Compaq TCP/IP Services for OpenVMS Version 5.3         SPD 46.46.15


          o  Metric server calculates and reports the DNS load on the local host.
             It includes dynamic configuration of logical names, which can be
             defined for CPU rating, compute interval, and debug level, as well
             as support for multihomed systems to allow load balancing of in-
             coming traffic across multiple IP addresses.

          o  Portmapper is a database system that allocates ports so that sys-
             tem managers do not need to preconfigure client applications with
             port numbers for each service.

          o  Auxiliary server process is the Compaq TCP/IP Services for OpenVMS
             implementation of the UNIX internet daemon (inetd). The auxiliary
             server greatly simplifies application writing, manages overhead by
             reducing simultaneous server processes, provides system security
             through authentication of service requests, and supports event and
             error logging.

          o  Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is a superset of the Boot-
             strap Protocol (BOOTP). In addition to BOOTP functionality (answer-
             ing bootstrap requests), DHCP offers robust configuration services,
             including IP address, subnet masks, and default gateways. The DHCP
             server can be configured to support BOOTP clients. If BOOTP is en-
             abled without DHCP, DHCP functionality is not available.

          o  DHCP dynamically updates BIND using a feature that allows DHCP clients
             to be configured with a registered name. DHCP uses this name to as-
             sign an address when it updates the BIND database. In addition, this
             release offers both a DHCP client and server, which provides a cen-
             tralized approach to the configuration and maintenance of IP ad-
             dress space. With DHCP server, the system manager can provide dy-
             namic allocation of IP addresses from an OpenVMS host.

          Management Control Program

          The Compaq TCP/IP Services for OpenVMS product provides the Manage-
          ment Control Program, which is a comprehensive, easy-to-use network
          management tool based on familiar OpenVMS DCL command syntax. These
          commands let system managers configure and monitor the product com-
          ponents locally.

          The flexible configuration process includes an interactive configu-
          ration procedure.

          Startup and shutdown files are provided for individual services, al-
          lowing system managers to stop and start individual services without
          affecting the operation of the remaining TCP/IP Services software.

          Support for both DCL or UNIX management commands provides a choice of
          methods for configuring and managing the network connections and the
          TCP/IP Services software.

          ing APIs for programmers to develop customized applications:

          o  Berkeley Sockets and Sockets Library provide UNIX like access for
             TCP, UDP, and raw IP to applications written in the C programming
             language. The library includes support for:

             -  Both IPv4 and IPv6 basic socket interface extensions for IPv6
                (RFC 2553 and IETF updates)

             -  Advanced sockets API for IPv6 (RFC 2292 and IETF updates)

          o  The $QIO interface extends the OpenVMS system services for socket
             communications, providing access to TCP, UDP, and IP for applica-
             tions written in supported programming languages.

          o  The SRI $QIO interface translates older, incompatible SRI $QIO in-
             terfaces into $QIO interfaces.

          o  ONC RPC provides an industry-standard, portable API for program-
             mers who do not have an in-depth knowledge of networking protocols.
             This is an efficient alternative to application development using
             sockets.

          o  Extensible Simple Network Management Protocol (eSNMP) provides rou-
             tines for building SNMP subagents.

          PATHWORKS, Advanced Server, and DECnet over TCP/IP

          The Compaq TCP/IP Services for OpenVMS product includes the PATHWORKS
          IP (PWIP) driver and the PWIP ancillary control process (PWIP_ACP) for
          improved PATHWORKS/Advanced Server and TCP/IP integration.

          The PWIP driver allows communication between OpenVMS systems running
          both PATHWORKS Advanced Server and TCP/IP Services software, and per-
          sonal computers running PATHWORKS 32 client software. It also enables
          the DECnet-over-TCP/IP feature, which is included with the DECnet-Plus
          for OpenVMS. (For more information, see the DECnet-Plus for OpenVMS
          documentation.)
