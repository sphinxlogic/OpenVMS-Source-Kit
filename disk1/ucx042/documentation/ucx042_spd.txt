           1 DESCRIPTION

              The DIGITAL TCP/IP Services for OpenVMS software product
              (also known as UCX) is the OpenVMS implementation of the
              industry-standard TCP/IP suite of communications protocols
              defined in the TCP/IP layered model.

              Based on the UNIX Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD)
              Version 4.3 software, the DIGITAL TCP/IP Services
              for OpenVMS product is layered software that provides
              interoperability and resource sharing between OpenVMS
              systems, UNIX systems, and other systems that support the
              TCP/IP protocol suite and the Network File System (NFS)
              product from Sun Microsystems.

              The DIGITAL TCP/IP Services for OpenVMS product makes it
              possible for OpenVMS users to connect to heterogeneous
              networks and accomplish a variety of tasks:

              o  Network file access - users can access files on remote
                 hosts.

              o  Electronic mail - users can exchange messages between
                 hosts.

              o  Application development - application programmers can
                 develop TCP/IP applications for communication between
                 local and remote hosts.

              o  Download and file transfer - users can exchange files
                 between hosts.

              o  User information - users can access information about
                 other users logged onto the local or remote host.

              o  Remote management - system managers can monitor the
                 UCX network and applications from remote management
                 stations.

              o  Remote terminal access - users can access a remote
                 system as if their terminal is connected directly to
                 that system.

              o  Remote command execution - users can issue commands to
                 remote hosts.

                                                                       1

 






              o  Remote printing - users can send or receive print jobs
                 to or from remote printers.

              o  Remote file copy - users can copy files that reside on
                 remote hosts.

              o  Remote booting - system managers can boot remote nodes.

              Internetworking with TCP/IP hides the hardware details
              of each individual network and allows computers to
              communicate independently of their physical network
              connections. Internetworking uses a uniform set of
              protocols to define behavior on an internet for all nodes
              using supported network media. TCP/IP provides both a
              standard transport mechanism and full-duplex, reliable,
              stream communication services for software applications.

        4 Network Interface Layer Support

              With support for multiple network interfaces for each
              physical network controller, the DIGITAL TCP/IP Services
              for OpenVMS software allows OpenVMS systems to connect to
              individual host computers on different types of networks:

              o  Ethernet

              o  Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI)

              o  Token Ring

              o  Asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) (Alpha systems only)

              Individual host computers can also connect with other
              hosts or networks over serial communications lines using
              either the Serial Line Internet Protocol (SLIP or CSLIP)
              or the Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) (OpenVMS Alpha
              Version 7.1 only).

        5 Internet Layer Support

              The DIGITAL TCP/IP Services for OpenVMS product supports
              the following Internet layer protocols that work together
              to move data around the internet:

              o  Internet Protocol (IP) - a connectionless packet
                 delivery service

              o  Routing Information Protocol (RIP) - enables gateways
                 to exchange current routing information about hosts and
                 directly connected networks

        4

 






              o  Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) - provides
                 diagnostic functions and handles error and control
                 messages

              o  Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) - dynamically maps an
                 IP address to a physical hardware address

        6 Transport Layer Support

              To provide either connection-oriented or connectionless
              data transmission between two hosts (either local or
              remote), the DIGITAL TCP/IP Services for OpenVMS product
              supports both TCP and UDP protocols. These protocols form
              the bridge between the Application layer and the Internet
              layer:

              o  Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) - provides
                 connection-oriented, reliable, sequenced data transfers
                 for applications that must guarantee delivery of the
                 data

              o  User Datagram Protocol (UCP) - provides fast,
                 connectionless data transfers for applications that
                 do not require delivery confirmation

        7 Application Layer Support

              The DIGITAL TCP/IP Services for OpenVMS product supports
              numerous Application layer protocols that allow OpenVMS
              users to:

              o  Run software on remote systems

              o  Transfer data files between local and remote systems

              o  Share remote system resources such as disk storage
                 space and printers as if they were directly connected
                 to the user's local system

              o  Send and receive electronic mail messages locally or
                 across the worldwide Internet

              o  Provide consistent, reliable, and efficient network
                 services to all users on the internet

                                                                       5

 






              Remote Computing

              With TELNET, an OpenVMS user can log into remote hosts in
              the network. The TELNET features include:

              o  Simultaneous multiple sessions

              o  IBM 3270 model terminal emulation (TN3270)

              o  Support for both OpenVMS-style and UNIX-style
                 interfaces

              The popular UNIX Remote commands, called R commands, let
              OpenVMS users work in accounts on remote internet hosts
              that are either UNIX or other OpenVMS systems. The DIGITAL
              TCP/IP Services for OpenVMS software supports the RLOGIN,
              RSH, REXEC, and RMT/RCD commands.

              The Finger utility enables users to obtain information
              about each user on local or remote systems. This
              information includes user name, account name, and the
              program the user is running.

              File Transfer

              OpenVMS users transfer data files between local and remote
              systems through the use of the following components:

              o  File Transfer Protocol (FTP) - transfers files between
                 hosts

              o  Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP) - downloads and
                 transfers files

              o  The remote copy (rcp) command - copies files to or from
                 remote hosts

              Resource Sharing

              The DIGITAL TCP/IP Services for OpenVMS software provides
              network printing through the line printer/line printer
              daemon (LPR/LPD) protocols. LPD provides remote printing
              services for UNIX and OpenVMS client hosts through local
              and remote print queues. Once the print queues are set up
              by the system manager, OpenVMS client users issue the DCL
              command PRINT and UNIX client users typically issue the
              lpr command.

        6

 






              The TELNET print symbiont (TELNETSYM) lets users print
              remotely during a TELNET session. With TELNETSYM, the
              local OpenVMS system drives a remote printer as if it were
              directly connected.

              With the robust Network File System (NFS) server software,
              NFS client users gain transparent access to remote
              file services. With NFS, when a user accesses files and
              directories from a remote system, they appear to reside on
              the local system regardless of operating system, hardware
              type, or architectural differences between the local and
              remote systems. The PC-NFS daemon allows the NFS client
              software to run on a personal computer. The NFS server
              promotes data sharing among clients through a central
              data storage facility for OpenVMS and UNIX files. The NFS
              services are available where specific implementations of
              NFS exist on both the client and server systems.

              Electronic Mail

              With the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), OpenVMS
              users can send and receive electronic mail to and from
              local and remote hosts. The DIGITAL  TCP/IP Services
              for OpenVMS implementation of SMTP uses the OpenVMS Mail
              facility, which automatically recognizes an SMTP host
              address in the format smith@widgets.com.

              The SMTP server works with the Post Office Protocol (POP)
              server to provide a reliable mail service. With POP as
              the mail repository, PC clients are assured that mail is
              accepted even when the PC is turned off.

              Network Services

              With the following DIGITAL TCP/IP Services for OpenVMS
              management components, network and system managers can
              provide consistent, reliable, and efficient services to
              their users, with minimal interruption:

              o  Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) - a master
                 agent and subagents that allow the UCX system to be
                 managed by a management station on the network.

              o  Network Time Protocol (NTP) - an environment to
                 synchronize time between hosts on a TCP/IP network.

                                                                       7

 






              o  Berkeley Internet Name Domain (BIND) - a distributed
                 database system that distributes and manages host
                 information so hosts do not need to know the address
                 of every other host on the internet. The BIND server
                 translates the Domain Name System (DNS) host names
                 into IP addresses. This feature complements the BIND
                 resolver, which is the client component of BIND that
                 requests node-name-to-address translations from a BIND
                 server.

              o  Portmapper - a database system that allocates ports
                 so system managers do not need to preconfigure client
                 applications with port numbers for each service.

              o  Auxiliary server - a process that greatly simplifies
                 application writing and manages overhead by reducing
                 simultaneous server processes; eliminates high overhead
                 surrounding services processes; provides system
                 security through authentication of service requests;
                 and supports event and error logging.

              o  The Bootstrap Protocol (BOOTP) - a process that answers
                 bootstrap requests from remote devices.

        8 Management Control Program

              The DIGITAL TCP/IP Services for OpenVMS product provides
              the UCX Management Control Program (UCP), which is a
              comprehensive, easy-to-use network management tool that
              includes over 100 OpenVMS-style commands. These commands
              let system managers locally configure and monitor the UCX
              components.

        9 Logical Names and Command Procedures

              Startup and shutdown command procedures are available for
              all the components. In addition, logical names shorten
              the time it takes to complete management tasks for various
              applications such as FTP, NFS, SMTP, and POP.

              the following APIs for programmers to develop customized
              applications:

              o  Standard C Sockets and C Sockets Library - provides
                 UNIX-like access to TCP, UDP, and raw IP using the C
                 programming language.

              o  $QIO - provides access to TCP, UDP, and IP by extending
                 OpenVMS system services for socket communications.
                 Supports any programming language.

              o  SRI $QIO - translates older, non-UCX $QIO interfaces
                 into $QIO interfaces.

              o  Sun RPC - provides an industry-standard, portable API
                 for programmers who do not have an in-depth knowledge
                 of networking protocols. An efficient alternative to
                 application development using sockets.

              o  Extensible Simple Network Management Protocol (eSNMP) -
                 provides eSNMP routines for building eSNMP subagents.

        11 PATHWORKS Integration

              The DIGITAL TCP/IP Services for OpenVMS product supports
              the PATHWORKS IP driver for improved PATHWORKS and TCP/IP

              or the POLYCENTER Software Installation utility (Alpha
              systems).

              A menu-driven configuration procedure makes it easy to
              enable the full range of components and services or only
              those needed. In addition, management commands and logical
              names let you modify the default characteristics of the
              components and services to fit the needs of the network.


                                                                       9
