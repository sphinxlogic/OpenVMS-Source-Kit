PRODUCT NAME:  Compaq FMS for OpenVMS, Version 2.4     SPD 45.06.01
               (Forms Management System)

DESCRIPTION

Compaq FMS for OpenVMS (FMS) is a mature, character-cell based forms
management system for interactive applications running on OpenVMS sys-
tems that use video forms as the user interface. FMS provides appli-
cation programmers with a set of development tools to create and main-
tain forms-based user interfaces and a run-time system for display-
ing and managing the application's user interface at execution time.

FMS has been superseded by Compaq DECforms for OpenVMS. DECforms is
the preferred forms product for character cell terminal applications
and should be used for all new application development requiring a forms-
based user interface.

Features

Forms defined using FMS provide the programmer with the ability to use
the following features of VT terminals by Compaq:

o  Individual character attributes of reverse video, bold, blinking,
   and underline

o  Line attributes of double width, double height, and scrolled

o  Screen width attributes such as 80 or 132 column lines, and reverse
   video

o  Alternate character sets including the VT100 "special graphics char-
   acter set" for line drawing

                                                       January 2000

 

FMS form data structures are used by the Form Driver (FDV) during run
time to display forms, and to access and validate data entered by the
terminal operator. Forms can be created and modified interactively with
the interactive editing facility (FMS/EDIT), or they can be defined
as a source form description with the Form Language and then converted
to a form data structure using the Form Language Translator (FMS/TRANSLATE).
In general, forms larger than 54 lines in 80-column mode and 63 lines
in 132-column mode can only be created and modified with the Form Lan-
guage Translator.

Forms usually reside in form library files on disk and are retrieved
as needed by application programs at execution time. This arrangement
results in a high degree of independence between form data structures
and application programs. Forms can be modified without recompilation
or relinking of the application program. Forms can also be converted
into an object module and linked with application programs to create
memory-resident forms, or forms can be dynamically loaded into mem-
ory by the application program.

FMS applications use the Form Driver to control the display of forms,
their associated data fields, and the input and output of data into
fields. All data input from the terminal and output to the terminal
is passed as ASCII strings.

Data for each field in a FMS form is validated by the Form Driver. Field-
validation characters are used to construct a "field validation pic-
ture." During program execution, characters input or output to the field
are compared to the picture to determine if they are valid. In most
instances, the field picture can contain several different field val-
idation characters and also field-marker characters. Field-marker char-
acters, used to improve the readability of the displayed form, are trans-
parent to the application program.

Attributes from the following list can be assigned to each individ-
ual field:

o  Name of the Field

o  A default value

                                 2

 

o  A help message

o  Autotab

o  Clear Character

o  Display Only

o  Fixed Decimal

o  Indexed

o  Left Justify

o  Right Justify

o  Must Fill

o  No Echo

o  Response Required

o  Supervisor Only

o  Uppercase

o  User action routines and associated data parameters

o  Zero Fill

o  Zero Suppress

The attributes assigned to each field are checked for validity when
the form is created. Some combinations of attributes are not legal.
Each form has attributes that apply to the form as a whole. These at-
tributes include:

o  Name of the form

o  Name of an associated help form

o  Screen background (black, white, or do not change)

o  Screen width (80 columns, 132 columns, or do not change)

o  Screen area to clear when displaying the form

o  Terminal character set

                                 3

 

o  User action routines and associated data parameters

o  Video attributes to be used if the field being worked on is to be
   highlighted at run time

o  The order in which fields are to be accessed

o  Named Data

Application Development Utilities

Interactive Form Editor

The FMS/EDIT command invokes the interactive editing facility that is
used by the form developer to create and modify video forms. The cre-
ation of forms with the interactive editing facility is accomplished
in phases. The layout phase is used to specify the visual appearance
of the form, the background text, and what types of characters are to
be valid input to the fields. While laying out a form on the screen,
one has available a set of 48 function keys and key combinations. These
keys perform functions such as cursor movement, delete and undelete,
cut and paste, box drawing, video attribute assignment, centering, and
displaying Help. Additional phases are used to assign form and field
attributes, to enter Named Data, and to assign field access order. Named
Data and all form and field attributes, including user action routines,
are specified by filling in questionnaires. Highlighting is used to
indicate which field is being referred to during the field attribute
and the field order assignment phases. Finally, the test phase allows
the developer to interact with a form just as the end user would with-
out exiting the editing session.

Form Language Translator

The Form Language Translator provides an alternate means for defin-
ing forms. The Form Language is a free-form, keyword-oriented, declar-
ative language that provides the means to create and modify source form
descriptions with a text editor or program.



                                 4

 

The FMS/TRANSLATE command is used to convert the source form descrip-
tions (contained in a text file) to form data structures. The data struc-
tures created are equivalent to those created with the FMS interac-
tive editor. Existing form data structures can be converted back into
Form Language source code for modification or documentation by using
the FMS/DESCRIPTION/FULL command.

Other Application Development Aids

FMS provides additional facilities to aid in the application program
development process. The facilities are invoked with the following com-
mands:

o  FMS/LIBRARY - To create and maintain form libraries.

o  FMS/DESCRIPTION - To obtain any of the following basic types of de-
   scriptions of forms:

   -  /BRIEF - Summary information about a form, its fields, Named Data,
      and user action routines.

   -  /FULL - Text files containing Form Language statements suitable
      for input to the Form Language Translator.

   -  /DECLARATIONS - To obtain data division code that can be edited
      by the user to create a COBOL Data Division or DATATRIEVE Do-
      main Definition reflecting the names, lengths, and order of fields
      on the screen.

   -  /DISPLAY_IMAGE - A printable image of a form in either termi-
      nal image format (with escape sequences) or line printer for-
      mat (without escape sequences).

o  FMS/DIRECTORY - To obtain a directory list of forms in a library
   or in form files.

o  FMS/OBJECT - To generate an object module containing one or more
   form data structures that, when linked with the application pro-
   gram, will allow access to the forms through virtual memory.

o  FMS/VECTOR - To generate an object module containing a vector ta-
   ble of addresses that point to the user action routines that are
   linked with the application program.

                                 5

 

o  FMS/TEST - To invoke the form testing facility, which allows the
   application developer to display a form as an application program
   would, to type data into fields, and to display field Help.

Form Driver

The Form Driver is the run-time component of FMS. It consists of AST
reentrant, shareable subroutines that are called by application pro-
grams to control the interaction of the terminal, the user, and the
application program. The Form Driver provides facilities for manag-
ing multiple work areas (each of which contains a single form data struc-
ture). Multiple forms can be displayed on a single terminal screen.

Form Driver subroutines provide for terminal input and output, dis-
play of forms, manipulation of the screen, basic input validation and
formatting, calling user action routines, and responding to the ter-
minal operator's requests for help. Input and output can be specified
one field at a time or on a whole form basis.

The Form Driver has a number of features to facilitate fine tuning of
the application human interface. A timeout facility allows the appli-
cation program to continue execution after waiting a specified period
of time for the operator to enter the next character. Field video at-
tributes, cursor position, and Insert/Overstrike mode can be dynam-
ically altered by Form Driver calls in the application program. Field
highlighting, controlled by the Form Driver, causes the video attributes
of each field to be altered as the cursor enters the field and to be
restored to their original state when the operator exits the field.

The Form Driver may be purchased separately for systems that require
only run-time support for applications using FMS.

Named Data

The Form Driver supports the creation of parameter-driven applications
by providing Named Data. Named Data are form constants that can be stored
as part of the form data structure and retrieved at execution time by
calls in the application program. Named Data allows information needed
by the application program (such as form linkage, operator messages
and other human language information, and data validation criteria for

                                 6

 

user subroutines) to be defined, stored, and modified independently
of the application program.

User Action Routines

User action routines (UARs) are procedures written by the user in any
supported OpenVMS programming language. UARs are associated with forms
and fields during the creation of form data structures and are auto-
matically called by the Form Driver under the following conditions:

o  When processing for a field is finished

o  Before and after processing the terminal operator's Help request

o  When the terminal operator presses a function key

o  When a screen refresh operation is requested

The Form Driver transfers program control to the user action routine
under the circumstances defined. The user action routine has avail-
able to it (through Form Driver calls) a parameter string of 80 char-
acters (defined as part of the form) which can be used to give pro-
cessing information and the current Form Driver context.

Sample Application Program

The Sample Application Program (SAMP) is a supported FMS demonstra-
tion program, included in the distribution kit, and is used to cer-
tify proper installation of FMS. The documentation for FMS gives ex-
amples from the Sample Application Program. The sample programs (in
each of the documented programming languages) and form descriptions
are included in the documentation and in the distribution kit. The Sam-
ple Application Program can be installed on the target system at the
user's discretion.

Printing Forms

Form images can be created and written to a file for subsequent print-
ing by either an application program using a Form Driver call, FDV$PRINT_
SCREEN, or by a terminal operator using an FMS DCL command, FMS/DESCRIPTION
/DISPLAY_IMAGE. The following screen images can be created:

                                 7

 

Line Printer Image - Line drawing graphic characters are converted to
standard printable ASCII characters and all other characters from al-
ternate character sets are ignored.

Terminal Image - All escape sequences and control characters are in-
cluded to present an exact image of the screen as displayed. This im-
age can be output properly only to a printer that understands or can
interpret the control characters and escape sequences used by the cur-
rent terminal.
