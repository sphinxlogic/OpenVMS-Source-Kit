PRODUCT NAME:  Compaq DECnet-Plus Version 7.3 for OpenVMS VAX   SPD
25.03.45

Description

Compaq DECnet-Plus Version 7.3 for OpenVMS VAX (formerly known as DEC-
net/OSI) is an implementation of Phase V of the DIGITAL Network Ar-
chitecture (DNA) for the OpenVMS VAX operating system.
Compaq DECnet-Plus integrates DECnet and Open Systems Interconnection
(OSI) network protocols, allowing both stacks to share integrated net-
work functions up to the Transport layer. Upper layers have been im-
plemented as separate towers, allowing existing DECnet and OSI appli-
cations to share the integrated Transport layer. Existing DECnet Phase
IV and new DECnet and OSI applications are supported by DECnet-Plus.
In combination with TCP/IP protocol stacks, OpenVMS systems can par-
ticipate in multivendor, multiprotocol networks adhering to open net-
working standards.

Compaq DECnet-Plus for OpenVMS features include:

o  The ability to run DECnet and OSI applications over TCP/IP trans-
   ports.

o  Continued support for 32-bit network applications.

o  Host-based routing, which includes communication with nodes run-
   ning DECnet Phase IV and OSI protocols, FDDI large packets, and X.25
   switched and permanent virtual circuits.

o  FAST configuration option, which allows quick configuration upgrades
   from Phase IV to Phase V.

o  X.25 network management interface, providing efficient wide area
   network (WAN) management.

o  The ability to configure all members of a cluster from any clus-
   ter member.

o  The ability to generate an OpenVMS audit event when a connection
   is established.

o  OSI application programming interfaces (APIs).

o  Expanded naming options, allowing the use of a larger Local names-
   pace, DECdns, and/or DNS/BIND as naming services.

o  Routing segregated mode to allow the Routing layer to choose a Phase
   IV router for those packets having a Phase IV compatible address.
   (Packets having a Phase V extended address are sent to a Phase V
   router by default.) This is a configurable option.

o  Reverse path caching to capture path information for later use in
   reaching remote systems.

o  Increased network size, supported through the use of ISO OSI ad-
   dressing.

o  Simplified installation and configuration process.

o  The Network Control Language (NCL). Network management is based on
   DNA CMIP, Compaq's implementation of the OSI international stan-
   dard Common Management Information Protocol.

o  A graphical network management user interface, net$mgmt, for im-
   proved network management, using NCL.

o  An NCP (Network Control Program) emulator to facilitate installa-
   tion of layered products written for DECnet Phase IV.

o  Installation using the POLYCENTER Software Installation utility.

o  Support for topologies using multicircuit and multihomed end nodes.

o  Dynamic connections over X.25 networks.

Compaq DECnet-Plus for OpenVMS includes OSI implementation in accor-
dance with current U.S. and U.K. GOSIP requirements:

      FDDI LANs, and DDCMP for backwards compatibility. HDLC support
      includes the LAPB (Link Access Protocol Balanced) protocol for
      X.25 communications.

   -  Physical layer, with CSMA/CD, HDLC, and FDDI devices supported.

Compaq DECnet-Plus for OpenVMS offers task-to-task communications, file
management, downline system and task loading, network command termi-
nals, and network resource sharing capabilities using DNA, OSI, and
TCP/IP protocols. DECnet-Plus for OpenVMS communicates with adjacent
and non-adjacent DECnet Phase IV, PATHWORKS, DECnet-Plus implementa-
tions on other OpenVMS systems, ULTRIX, and Tru64 UNIX systems, as well
as systems running TCP/IP transports and on OSI-compliant systems from
other vendors.

OpenVMS programs written in native-mode programming languages can use
DECnet-Plus for OpenVMS capabilities.

                                 3

 

Depending on the system configuration, networks combining Compaq DECnet-
Plus for OpenVMS systems with other DECnet, OSI, and TCP/IP products
may limit the functions available if all products do not support equal
features.

Data Link Layer

Compaq DECnet-Plus for OpenVMS uses synchronous, Ethernet and FDDI com-
munications controllers to interface with other network nodes.

LAN connectivity is provided by the CSMA/CD and FDDI controllers and
drivers supporting ISO 8802-2 Logical Link Control (LLC) Type 1 con-
nectionless service and ISO 8802-3 LLC Type 2. Compaq DECnet-Plus also
supports Ethernet Version 2 packet formats on CSMA/CD devices.

Use of FDDI packets larger than 1500 bytes requires a Phase V router
on the FDDI LAN. The maximum Phase V FDDI packet size is 4352 bytes
for use with other Phase V network nodes. As with cluster alias sup-
port, you can configure the Phase V router to run the Phase IV dis-
tance vector routing protocol or the Phase V link state routing pro-
tocol.

Supported synchronous devices allow for the use of DDCMP, DIGITAL HDLC,
LAPB/E and SDLC protocols. BISYNC and GENBYTE protocols are also sup-
ported on some options. WAN device drivers are required by X.25 to es-
tablish host-based wide area connections.

Synchronous controllers use DDCMP or HDLC, when connected either di-
rectly or through modems, to provide full- or half-duplex communica-
tions over point-to-point lines. Synchronous DDCMP multipoint trib-
utary connections are also supported. Asynchronous controllers use DD-
CMP, when connected either directly or through modems, to provide only
full duplex communications over point-to-point lines. Error correct-
ing and data suppression modems are not supported.

Asynchronous lines are supported only to other systems running DECnet-
Plus for OpenVMS VAX, DECnet-VAX, DECnet-RSX, and DECnet-DOS.



                                 4

 

DDCMP operation is not supported in cases where an asynchronous phys-
ical communications line is emulated by lower-level protocols or com-
munications subsystems. Examples of this include X.29 Virtual Termi-
nals, asynchronous connections as emulated by terminal servers, and
connections through data switches.

Compaq DECnet-Plus for OpenVMS allows a maximum of 32 circuits on a
full routing node and up to four circuits defined and operational on
an end system. This capability allows a single end system to be con-
nected to up to four separate LANs or WANs. Compaq recommends that the
circuits be equal in capacity and connectivity.

X.25

The Compaq DECnet-Plus for OpenVMS VAX license includes the right to
use X.25 Access software, formerly known as VAX P.S.I. Access. The right
to use X.25 Native Mode software, formerly known as VAX P.S.I., re-
quires an additional license. See the Optional Software section of this
SPD for ordering information. The X.25 software in Compaq DECnet-Plus
for OpenVMS is backward compatible with systems running the older X.25
Native Mode products. Applications written to the older X.25 inter-
faces will continue to run, unchanged, with the X.25 software supported
on DECnet-Plus.

The X.25 Native Mode software allows suitably configured DECnet-Plus
systems to connect to PSDNs that conform to CCITT recommendation X.25
(1980 or 1984) and/or to International Standards (ISO) 7776 and 8208.
This allows a DECnet-Plus system to function as data terminal equip-
ment (DTE) or be addressed as data circuit terminating equipment (DCE)
as follows:

o  A packet-mode DTE connected to a supported PSDN (supported PSDNs
   are listed in Table 4) conforming to CCITT Recommendation X.25 (1980,
   1984)

o  A packet-mode DTE connected to a CSMA/CD LAN conforming to ISO 8802-
   3 using ISO Logical Link Control Type 2 (LLC2) as specified in ISO
   8881


                                 5

 

o  A packet-mode DTE/DCE connected to a DCE/DTE conforming to ISO 7776
   and 8208

You can configure X.25 for native operation to support direct connec-
tions from a VAX system to one or more PSDNs, each of which may have
one or more DTEs. The software also allows communication with any non-
Compaq X.25 system on the same LAN that supports the ISO Logical Link
Control Type 2 (LLC2) protocol.

Direct access to a PSDN (using the supported device drivers) requires
an X.25 license. See the Optional Software section.

X.25 Access Software

DECnet-Plus logical links are established by OpenVMS to connect the
X.25 Access system to the X.25 Connector system. These links may use
any supported DECnet-Plus communications path between the X.25 Access
system and the Connector system, provided they do not use an X.25 con-
nection. X.25 Access uses these links to transmit X.25 or X.29 mes-
sages between the Connector system and the X.25 Access system.

Note that successful use of an X.29 connection, either for incoming
X.29 calls or by means of the host-based PAD (packet assembler/disassembler)
utility supplied with X.25 Access, depends on the DECnet-Plus circuit
between the Access and Connector system having a low response time.
This configuration requires high-speed DECnet-Plus connections and few
intermediate routing systems.

A single X.25 Access system can connect to one or more Connector sys-
tems concurrently, and hence access all PSDN(s) accessible from those
Connector systems. When X.25 Access is used, one of these Connector
systems/PSDN combinations must be established as the default gateway
for outbound and inbound traffic.

Features

The X.25 software provides the Connection-Oriented Network Service (CONS)
to allow mapping between a destination NSAP address and a destination
DTE address according to ISO 8348.

                                 6

 

The X.25 software can be used in the following ways:

o  Process-to-process (X.25) communications

o  Process-to-terminal (X.29) communications

o  Terminal-to-process (X.29) communications

Process-to-Process (X.25) Communications

The X.25 software provides access for OpenVMS user programs written
in VAX MACRO and high-level languages such as VAX FORTRAN. The X.25
software does not support programs executing in PDP-11 compatibility
mode.

The X.25 programming interface allows application programs to access
the service interface to the packet level by means of the standard Open-
VMS QIO interface. Functions include setting up and breaking network
connections, data transmission and reception, sending and receiving
interrupt messages, and resetting virtual circuits. The interface al-
lows splitting and recombining of messages that are longer than the
packet size selected for the circuit.

The X.25 programming interface enables an application program using
OpenVMS system services to communicate with complementary software on
other systems (Compaq or non-Compaq DTEs) accessible through the X.25
connection.

Process-to-Terminal and Terminal-to-Process (X.29) Communications

The X.25 software supports terminal communications according to CCITT
recommendations X.3, X.28, and X.29 for outgoing and incoming termi-
nal traffic.

X.25 native users may make outgoing calls to other Compaq or non-Compaq
CPUs, or suitable network PADs accessible through a PSDN, using the
X.29 programming interface or by using the host-based PAD. The PAD fa-
cility accepts DCL-style commands or CCITT X.28 commands.


                                 7

 

The X.29 interactive terminal interface allows remote asynchronous ter-
minals (character-mode DTEs) connected to the network to communicate
with the X.25 host in a manner similar to local terminals. Dissimi-
larities might appear as a result of delays caused by the PSDN(s) and
the various PAD parameter settings chosen by the user or peculiar to
the PSDN(s). In this case, the remote PAD must convert code between
ASCII and the code the terminal uses. Note that there may be some re-
strictions imposed by the PSDN(s).

Terminal parameters defined in the X.3 recommendation are supported
explicitly. Network-specific enhancements or extensions to the X.3 pa-
rameters are available at both the X.29 programming interface and the
host-based PAD user interface. Terminal processes that depend on these
extensions might cause problems when used on other PSDNs or when ac-
cessing one PSDN through another (for example, international access).

The X.29 terminal interface is compatible with the local terminal in-
terface, except for those facilities where the PSDN does not provide
adequate support. The X.29 interface includes support for specific X.29
signaling.

The host-based PAD employs a DCL-style command syntax, offering the
ability to reference the CCITT PAD parameters symbolically, as well
as an interface that conforms to the standard CCITT command signals.
The host-based PAD also offers the capability of running multiple X.29
sessions using the OpenVMS SPAWN and ATTACH commands. The host-based
PAD supports reception of reselection messages to allow X.29 calls to
be redirected to another DTE.

The X.29 programming interface is similar to the X.25 one and allows
an OpenVMS process to control the virtual circuit (for example, to mod-
ify PAD parameters or clear a call). You can also use the X.29 pro-
gramming interface to make an outgoing call to a remote PAD. The pro-
gramming interface allows generation of PAD reselection messages.

The maximum number of terminals supported (both local and remote X.29)
must not exceed the number supported by OpenVMS. The use of PVCs (per-
manent virtual circuits) for X.29 connections is not defined by the
1980, 1984, and 1988 CCITT Recommendations and is not supported.

Static X.25 Circuits

X.25 allows the use of DECnet-Plus facilities over static X.25 cir-
cuits. These circuits are called statically assigned circuits.

Virtual Circuits

X.25 native software supports both permanent virtual circuits (PVCs)
and switched virtual circuits (SVCs). One virtual circuit is used for
each:

o  Incoming or outgoing X.29 terminal connection

o  X.25 connection, using either a SVC or PVC

X.25 native supports a maximum of 4,096 virtual circuits per system.

X.25 Access supports a maximum of 900 virtual circuits per system.

Note that each virtual circuit requires a certain amount of memory so
the number of logical virtual circuits possible on any single system
is limited by the available memory.

Configuration

The X.25 software includes a configuration procedure to configure a
VAX system. This menu-based interface allows network managers to cre-
ate an initialization script to configure entities and their attributes
after initial installation.

X.25 Accounting

The X.25 Accounting utility enables the system manager to obtain in-
formation PSDN usage. X.25 Accounting can extract the information col-
lected and display the information directly on a terminal or write the
information to a file. It can also extract information for selected
records, or produce a summary. The X.25 Accounting utility is compat-
ible with the OpenVMS Accounting utility.

For incoming X.29 calls, no information about the process/account on
to which a user is logged can be stored. However this information may
be obtained by correlation with OpenVMS accounting records.

                                 9

 

X.25 Security

X.25 security allows control of both remote DTE access to the X.25 soft-
ware, and access to the PSDN(s) by OpenVMS processes. X.25 security
allows for access control on the basis of:

o  The remote DTE numbers involved, either on the basis of individ-
   ual DTE numbers or groups of DTE numbers with common leading dig-
   its.

o  The process making the outgoing call or the application handling
   the incoming call.




























                                10

 

X.25 Mail

The X.25 Mail utility allows communications through electronic mail
between two OpenVMS systems running the X.25 software in native or in
access mode. Refer to the OpenVMS Operating System SPD 25.01.xx for
more information about OpenVMS Mail.

Synchronous Communications Devices

The X.25 Native Mode software supports the synchronous communications
devices listed in the Communications Devices section, Table 2. The de-
vices are different in many respects, particularly in the amount of
CPU used. For optimum performance, Compaq recommends the use of a di-
rect memory access (DMA) device.

Line Interfaces

The electrical line interface used for PSDN communications depends on
the hardware device used. X.25 Native Mode software provides only the
electrical interface of a DTE rather than a DCE, and does not provide
clock signals. Therefore, an external clock source (for example, a mo-
dem) is required.

The range of supported synchronous communications devices covers V.24,
V.35 and V.10, RS232, RS422 and RS423 interfaces over point-to-point,
4-wire, synchronous, full-duplex lines at transmission rates up to 256K
bits per second.

Prerequisite Support

For new PSDNs, the customer and Compaq should jointly prepare a Net-
work Profile and Customer Support Plan covering all the intended net-
work systems, their usage of SVCs, PVCs, and other network facilities,
and their support. Without this Network Profile and Customer Support
Plan, Compaq cannot support the network connections.

Optional Facility Support



                                11

 

Support for any given CCITT X.25 facility depends on support for it
in the appropriate supported PSDN. Generally, X.25 software is designed
to disallow use of facilities that the PSDN does not support. Table 1
shows the options that X.25 is capable of supporting, rather than what
X.25 actually supports when used on a particular PSDN. The X.25 prod-
uct documentation describes specific facility availability for the sup-
ported public PSDNs.

Wide Area Network (WAN) Device Drivers

The WAN device drivers included in Compaq DECnet-Plus for OpenVMS VAX
support synchronous communications. The device drivers all offer a sup-
ported user ($QIO) interface.

The device drivers all support full-duplex and half-duplex operation,
where appropriate to the protocol. DDCMP and SDLC device drivers sup-
port both point-to-point and multipoint tributary operation. `BISYNC'
refers to the IBM implementation of bisynchronous protocol. The GEN-
BYTE protocol is a general byte-oriented protocol for use with user-
written framing routines on some of the device drivers.

The maximum permitted line speed depends on the line interface stan-
dard used and must not exceed 19.29 Kbits/second for an RS232 V.24 stan-
dard interface. There may be additional line speed restrictions for
other line interface standards. For more information, refer to the SPDs

                                15

 

for the synchronous interfaces. The Compaq communications layered prod-
ucts may not necessarily support operation of the synchronous inter-
face at the maximum speed supported by the device driver. Refer to the
appropriate Software Product Description for the Compaq communications
layered product for precise details of supported configurations.

In all cases, the data throughput over the synchronous lines is de-
pendent on the user applications and system environment.

The device drivers support modem control signal operation. Refer to
the product descriptions for the appropriate synchronous interface for
details of the modem signals supported by an individual device.

Supported controllers are listed in the Communications Devices sec-
tion, Table 2.

WAN device drivers include a pseudodriver (WANDRIVER) that provides
a programming interface to the Data Link level for the LAPB, DEC-HDLC,
and DDCMP protocols.

Network Layer

Compaq DECnet-Plus for OpenVMS supports the Connectionless-Mode Net-
work Service (CLNS) and the Connection-Oriented Network Service (CONS).

Exchange of routing information between end systems and routers uses
the ISO 9542 ES-IS routing protocol. This protocol allows DECnet-Plus
systems to autoconfigure as end systems with ISO 9542-conformant routers.

Addresses conform to the ISO 8348 Addendum 2 specification, allowing
the support of large network topologies. As long as the system address
stays within the addressing range of Phase IV systems (up to 1,023 sys-
tems per area and up to 63 areas per network), and uses the same ini-
tial domain part (IDP), you can use Phase IV or Phase V routers.

The Network layer supports the capability of an end system to be mul-
ticircuited and multihomed. Multicircuit support allows multiple cir-
cuits to be active simultaneously. This functionality increases net-
work reliability and data throughput. Multihomed end-system support
allows a system to have up to three network entity titles.

                                16

 

Segregated routing mode is a settable attribute. It directs routing
to choose a Phase IV router for those packets having a destination ad-
dress that can be translated to the Phase IV format. All other pack-
ets are sent to a Phase V router, if available.

The Routing layer is able to cache information about the paths that
are used to reach remote nodes.

Transport Layer

Compaq DECnet-Plus for OpenVMS provides support for:

o  OSI Transport protocol as specified in ISO 8073

o  RFC 1006 and RFC 1859 to allow DECnet and OSI applications to run
   over TCP/IP

o  Network Services Protocol (NSP)

NSP, RFC 1006, and OSI transports support communications between DEC-
net, TCP/IP, and OSI systems. NSP provides backward compatibility with
Phase IV DECnet systems.

RFC 1859 support for DECnet applications is provided by a kernel in-
terface that is implemented on all TCP/IP stacks available for use on
the OpenVMS operating system. The supported applications include all
licensed DECnet applications as well as layered products and user-written
applications that conform to the documented DECnet programming inter-
faces.

The RFC 1859 is a specification for running OSI applications over TCP/IP.
Operation of the FTAM and Virtual Terminal applications over a TCP/IP
network is supported along with other layered OSI applications such
as X.400 and X.500.

A separate TCP/IP stack is required on the same system with DECnet-
Plus. See the Optional Software section of this SPD for information
on supported TCP/IP products.

OSI transport supports transport classes 0, 2, and 4 on connection-
oriented networks and class 4 on connectionless networks.

                                17

 

OSI transport uses two types of network service:

o  The Connectionless-Mode Network Service (CLNS) using the Internet
   protocol (ISO 8473) and ES-IS protocol (ISO 9542) to communicate
   across linked subnetworks. The inactive subset of ISO 8473 (null
   internet) is also supported for communications over a single ISO
   8802-3 local area network.

o  The Connection-Oriented Network Service (CONS).

Upper Layers

Compaq DECnet-Plus for OpenVMS software provides the OSI upper layer
stack consisting of Session, Presentation and Application layers. The
Application layer provides Association Control Service Element (ACSE);
File Transfer, Management, and Access (FTAM); and Virtual Terminal (VT).

Compaq DECnet-Plus for OpenVMS also provides a range of DECnet appli-
cations and services including file and record access, remote termi-
nal access, mail, and phone.

Applications

Transport Options for Applications

You can run applications written to the DECnet upper layers over NSP,
OSI, or TCP/IP transports using RFC 1006 and RFC 1859. This includes
the network applications that are licensed with DECnet-Plus as well
as user-written applications that adhere to the documented DECnet pro-
gramming interfaces. The use of TCP/IP transports using RFC 1006 and
RFC 1859 does not require any modification to the existing applica-
tion.

You can run applications written to the OSI upper layers over OSI or
TCP/IP transports.

Remote File Transfer



                                18

 

Compaq DECnet-Plus for OpenVMS supports two upper layer protocols for
remote file transfer: the OSI protocol's File Transfer, Access, and
Management (FTAM) and the DECnet Data Access Protocol (DAP).

FTAM

FTAM supports file transfer, access, and management between a DECnet-
Plus for OpenVMS system and other systems with software adhering to
ISO 8571. In addition, FTAM is conformant with NIST Phase II and Phase
III agreements and is certified as being conformant to the released
specifications of U.S. GOSIP, U.K. GOSIP, and ENV41204.

In addition, FTAM:

o  Provides users the ability to create, delete, rename, view, and copy
   files using DCL commands.

o  Is implemented as an Application Service Element (ASE) of the OSI
   Application layer.

o  Acts as the initiator or as the responder in a connection.

o  Accesses and transfers files with both binary and character data.
   It supports FTAM-1, FTAM-2, FTAM-3, and NBS-9 document types.

Compaq DECnet-Plus for OpenVMS also supports gateway services between
FTAM and DAP.

A full description of the FTAM services in DECnet-Plus for OpenVMS is
provided in Appendix A of this document.

DAP

The DECnet Data Access Protocol (DAP) supports task-to-task communi-
cations, file and record access, and proxy access.

Task-to-Task Communications: For most applications, you can use task-
to-task communications in a transparent manner where the remote task
is treated as a full-duplex, record-oriented device. Transparent op-
eration is provided with the following interfaces: system service calls,

                                19

 

RMS calls (OPEN, GET, PUT, and CLOSE), and high-level language I/O state-
ments (which are mapped to RMS calls). A nontransparent mode of task-
to-task communications is offered by means of the system service in-
terface that extends the capabilities provided by the transparent mode.
These capabilities include support for interrupt messages and multi-
ple inbound connect requests.

Using Compaq DECnet-Plus for OpenVMS, an OpenVMS program written in
a native mode programming language can exchange messages with other
user programs.

File Access: File access is supported to and from remote DECnet-Plus
for OpenVMS systems, transparent to native mode high-level language
programs using RMS. User programs can sequentially read, create, and
delete files on a remote node.

Record Access: User programs can perform record level operations such
as GET, PUT, UPDATE, DELETE, FIND, and REWIND to access and modify files
residing on a remote OpenVMS node. In addition to sequential access
to a file, several other access methods are supported through RMS us-
ing DECnet-Plus for OpenVMS. These methods include random access by
relative record number, random access by key value, random access by
record file address (RFA), and block I/O access by virtual block num-
ber.

Proxy Access: Remote users can have access to up to 15 proxy accounts
on a specific remote system. One proxy account should be designated
as the default proxy account on the remote system.

Command Language File Management

You can use most OpenVMS DIGITAL Command Language (DCL) commands to
perform remote file operations. These commands include: ANALYZE, APPEND,
BACKUP, CLOSE, CONVERT, COPY, CREATE, DELETE, DIFFERENCES, DIRECTORY,
DUMP, OPEN, PRINT, PURGE, READ, SEARCH, SUBMIT, TYPE, and WRITE. The
operation of these commands is transparent except for commands that
invoke processing on a specific system (for example, SUBMIT/REMOTE and
PRINT/REMOTE). Only a node name added to a file specification is re-
quired to invoke the network capabilities using one of these commands.

                                20

 

Using the COPY command, a user can transfer sequential, relative, and
indexed-sequential (ISAM) files between DECnet-Plus for OpenVMS nodes
that support compatible file structures and record formats. Users can
transfer sequential or relative files with fixed length, variable length,
or variable length with fixed control field records between two DECnet-
Plus for OpenVMS systems. Similarly, multikeyed indexed files with vari-
able or fixed length records are supported.

The SUBMIT/REMOTE command allows command files residing on a remote
node to be submitted for execution at the remote node. The command file
must be in the format expected by the node responsible for execution.
DECnet-Plus for OpenVMS allows OpenVMS command files to be received
from other systems and executed.

The DCL command EXCHANGE/NETWORK allows the transfer of files to or
from heterogeneous systems. This command gives users the option to trans-
fer file types between MS-DOS, ULTRIX, and UNIX systems and OpenVMS
systems regardless of record semantics. Unlike the COPY command, which
preserves file and record organization during a file transfer, this
command enables the user to modify file and record attributes during
file transfer.

OSI Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)

The OSI application programming interfaces enable users to write dis-
tributed applications that communicate over open networks and use the
OSI services provided by DECnet-Plus.

The interfaces are provided under the Extended Function license and
include:

o  An interface to FTAM (File Transfer, Access, and Management)

o  Interfaces to the ACSE (Association Control Service Element) and
   Presentation layers

o  An interface to ROSE (Remote Operations Service Element)



                                21

 

o  An interface to the OSI Session layer

The interfaces permit application writers to use the services of the
OSI upper layers in their applications.

The APIs allow you to develop applications on DECnet-Plus systems. You
must compile and link source code with the APIs. The APIs are required
on the development system and the compile/link system. You can run the
resulting application on any DECnet-Plus system with the appropriate
operating system. The APIs are not required on these target systems.
See Appendix C for details on the OSI APIs.

Network Virtual Terminal

DECnet-Plus supports two upper layer protocols for terminal access:
the OSI Virtual Terminal protocol and the DECnet Command Terminal pro-
tocol.

Virtual Terminal

Virtual Terminal (VT) supports the ISO Virtual Terminal Protocol (ISO
9041). This protocol allows remote logins and access to remote appli-
cations between DECnet-Plus for OpenVMS systems and any remote sys-
tem, including multivendor systems, that also run an ISO-compliant Vir-
tual Terminal implementation.

Virtual Terminal is implemented as an Application Service Element (ASE)
of the OSI Application layer.

Virtual Terminal may act as the terminal/initiator (for a local user)
or as the host/responder (for the remote user).

A full description of Virtual Terminal features is provided in Appendix
B of this SPD.

Command Terminal

The DCL command SET HOST allows a terminal user on one DECnet-Plus for
OpenVMS node to establish a logical connection to another DECnet-Plus
node that uses the Command Terminal (CTERM) protocol. This connection

                                22

 

makes the terminal appear to be physically connected to the remote sys-
tem and the operator can use all the standard system and network util-
ities supported by that remote node. This capability is particularly
useful for doing remote program development and allows the terminal
users on smaller application-oriented systems to use the resources of
larger development-oriented systems.

Other interfaces are included in DECnet-Plus for OpenVMS. You can de-
velop programs and procedures based on these interfaces for functions
such as file access and task-to-task communications on individual sys-
tems. Because the DECnet-Plus for OpenVMS interfaces stay the same,
you can use the programs and procedures developed on an individual sys-
tem in a network environment without modifying them.

Services

Downline Loading

Compaq DECnet-Plus for OpenVMS allows for the loading of an unattended
system using the services provided by the Maintenance Operations Mod-
ule (MOM). MOM provides a set of maintenance operations over various
types of circuits by using the Maintenance Operations Protocol (MOP).
A loadable system is a system that has a load device enabled for MOP
service functions and for which a properly formatted load file is sup-
plied. Downline loading involves transferring a copy of the load file
image to a remote target node. Load requests can come from the local
DECnet-Plus for OpenVMS operator or from the target node. Downline load-
ing is supported for Compaq server products. However, this facility
is not supported over asynchronous DECnet-Plus for OpenVMS VAX con-
nections.

Downline Task Loading

Initial task images for loadable systems can be stored on OpenVMS file
system devices and loaded into remote nodes. Programs already execut-
ing on loadable systems can be checkpointed to the host OpenVMS file
system and later restored to main memory in the node. These features
simplify the operation of network systems that do not have mass stor-
age devices.

                                23

 

Downline task loading is not supported over asynchronous DECnet-Plus
for OpenVMS VAX connections.

Upline Dumping

Memory images of adjacent nodes connected by Compaq DECnet-Plus for
OpenVMS can be written or dumped into a file on an OpenVMS system. This
facility provides assistance in troubleshooting in the event of a sys-
tem crash. This facility is also supported for Compaq server products.

This facility is not supported over asynchronous DECnet-Plus for Open-
VMS VAX connections.

Mail

The OpenVMS Mail utility allows transmission of text messages between
users on systems supporting MAIL-11. The Compaq DECnet-Plus for Open-
VMS software allows users to exchange mail with users of other DECnet-
Plus systems.

Phone

The OpenVMS Phone utility allows users to send and receive data in-
teractively from one user's terminal to another user's terminal. DECnet-
Plus allows users on different systems in the same DECnet-Plus net-
work to exchange information.














                                24

 

OpenVMS Cluster Alias

Compaq DECnet-Plus for OpenVMS supports the ability to access nodes
in an OpenVMS Cluster using a separate alias node address, while re-
taining the ability to address each node in the cluster individually.
Not all network objects can be accessed using this mechanism. The max-
imum number of nodes supported for a cluster alias is 94. Refer to the
OpenVMS Cluster SPD (29.78.xx) for relevant restrictions.

DECnet-Plus no longer requires a cluster member to be configured as
a router. Clusters in a DECnet-Plus environment require a reachable
IS-IS compliant router on the LAN.

Network Management

Network management is provided with the Network Control Language (NCL).
Network management implements the DECnet-Plus layered model, based on
the Compaq hierarchical structure called Enterprise Management Archi-
tecture (EMA).

Users can access NCL through either a command line interface or a graph-
ical user interface (GUI) called net$mgmt. The GUI allows network man-
agers to view the status of network components and control those com-
ponents from a Motif-based window interface.

The Compaq DECnet-Plus for OpenVMS network management software allows
system and network managers to:

o  Control and monitor the operation of a network and provide infor-
   mation related to network traffic and performance

o  Configure network operating parameters

o  Start up and shut down network components as needed

o  Detect and isolate network problems, and return the network to ser-
   vice once repaired.

In addition, the network management software can provide information,
warning network managers of faulty or failing network components, both
hardware and software.

                                25

 

Network Command Language (NCL) is provided as a utility to the net-
work manager to perform the operations described above.

Network managers can also use NCL to test specific components of the
network. NCL enables transmission and reception of test messages ei-
ther between systems or through controller loopback arrangements. The
messages can then be compared for possible errors. NCL helps users iso-
late network problems.

Compaq DECnet-Plus for OpenVMS provides network event logging to a ter-
minal device, disk file, or remote system. NCL users can enable and
disable the event logging facility as well as optionally filter spe-
cific events.

NCL uses the DNA Common Management Information Protocol (CMIP), which
permits entity management from a single location anywhere in the DECnet-
Plus network.

The Common Trace Facility (CTF) allows the network manager to collect
and display information about specific protocol exchanges between sys-
tems.

Compaq DECnet-Plus for OpenVMS supports an ISO CMISE application pro-
gramming interface (API) conforming to the service definitions in ISO
9595. The API allows for development of applications that can commu-
nicate with other management applications conforming to ISO 9595 on
remote nodes in the network.

DECnet-Plus supports the DECnet Phase IV NCP for remote management of
Phase IV DECnet systems.

Name Service Options

Compaq DECnet-Plus for OpenVMS allows the use of one or more naming
services. The available services are DECdns, DNS/BIND, and the Local
namespace. Node name and addressing information is stored in the na-
tive name service; TCP/IP information is maintained in DNS/BIND, and
DECnet and OSI information is maintained in DECdns or the Local names-
pace.

                                26

 

When you use more than one name service, a configurable search list
defines the order in which the existing services are to be accessed.

Local Namespace

Using the Local namespace, you can define up to 100,000 nodes in a lo-
cal naming database. A migration tool is available to move the Phase
IV database to the new large local file format and/or DECdns format.

DNS/BIND

DECnet can now use TCP/IP naming and addressing information from the
DNS/BIND name service.

DECdns

Compaq DECnet-Plus for OpenVMS provides a global naming service called
the DIGITAL Distributed Naming Service (DECdns).

The full DECdns service provides a consistent, network-wide set of names
for network resources called the namespace. This namespace is main-
tained by one or more DECdns server systems. Compaq recommends that
DECdns servers be installed on at least two systems in every LAN. This
should provide adequate service and redundancy.

The features provided by DECdns include:

o  A networkwide name-to-attribute mapping service that allows selected
   Compaq applications to create, read, modify, and delete names in
   the namespace

o  A hierarchical structure permitting a large number of names to be
   stored and distributed across the network

o  Access control to each name in the namespace

o  Management and event logging

Distributed Time Service

                                27

 

Compaq DECnet-Plus for OpenVMS provides a network time service with
DECdts, the DIGITAL Distributed Time Service. DECdts provides precise,
fault-tolerant clock synchronization for systems in a LAN or WAN. Time
is provided in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) and can be used across
a global network. Several forms of time providers are supported, and
a callable interface for applications allows users to add their own
time providers. DECdts can be used by distributed applications to de-
termine event sequencing, duration, and scheduling.

Operation

DECnet-Plus is implemented under OpenVMS as an ancillary control pro-
cess (ACP) and a network device driver with Compaq-supplied executive-
level components and user-level programs.

The normal OpenVMS protection has been incorporated in the operation
of DECnet-Plus. For example, incoming connects, including file access
and file transfer requests, are protected by the normal OpenVMS lo-
gin and file protection mechanisms. Outgoing connects, including file
access and file transfer requests, can include user password infor-
mation that is implicitly specified by NCL, or explicitly specified
by the user for verification on the remote node.

Configuration and Performance

You can configure DECnet-Plus using either the BASIC or ADVANCED con-
figuration options.

Cluster nodes are configurable from any node within the cluster.

As with any network protocol, the performance of a given DECnet-Plus
for OpenVMS node is a function not only of the expected network traf-
fic and resultant processing, but also of the amount of concurrent pro-
cessing specific to that node. Thus, node performance depends on many
factors including:

o  CPU type

o  Number and type of devices attached to the particular CPU

                                28

 

o  Number of device interrupts per unit time

o  Communications line(s) characteristics

o  Number and size of buffers

o  Message size and frequency of transmission

o  Applications in use

It is important to note that the rate at which user data can be trans-
mitted (throughput) over a communications line can sometimes approach,
but will never exceed, the actual line speed. This is because the ac-
tual throughput is a function of many factors, including the line qual-
ity, protocol overhead, topology, and network application(s), as well
as the factors cited in this section.

The performance of DECnet-Plus is comparable to the performance of DEC-
net Phase IV.

   tape H-kits.

o  New features are documented extensively in the Release Notes.

Installation

DECnet-Plus software is customer installable. Installation services
are available for customers who request installation of the software
product by an experienced Compaq software specialist.

Compaq requires that a customer's first use of X.25 include Compaq In-
stallation Services. These services provide for installation of the
software product by an experienced Compaq software specialist.

Customer Responsibilities

Before Compaq Services can install the software, the customer must:

o  Ensure that the system meets the minimum hardware and software re-
   quirements (as specified in the relevant SPDs)

o  Prior to installing Compaq hardware or software, obtain, install,
   and demonstrate as operational any modems and other necessary cus-
   tomer equipment or facilities to which Compaq's communications hard-
   ware or software will connect

                                30

 

o  Designate one adjacent node to verify installation and connectiv-
   ity

o  Make available for a reasonable period of time, as mutually agreed
   upon by Compaq and the customer, all hardware communications fa-
   cilities and terminals that are to be used during installation.

Delays caused by any failure to meet these responsibilities will be
charged at the prevailing rate for time and materials.

Installation of Compaq DECnet-Plus for OpenVMS consists of the fol-
lowing tasks:

o  Verify that all components of Compaq DECnet-Plus for OpenVMS have
   been received.

o  Verify that the necessary versions of the OpenVMS software and doc-
   umentation are available.

o  Verify the appropriate SYSGEN parameters.
   Note: If a software specialist is required to modify the previously
   installed operating system parameters, a time and materials charge
   will apply.

o  Create any necessary Compaq DECnet-Plus for OpenVMS accounts and
   directories.

o  Enable software by registering the License Product Authorization
   Key (PAK) .

o  Install the Compaq DECnet-Plus software on the target system us-
   ing the POLYCENTER Software Installation utility .

o  Verify the proper installation of Compaq DECnet-Plus for OpenVMS
   by running a series of tests to show connectivity to a designated
   node.

Connectivity to all other nodes within the network is the responsi-
bility of the customer. Compaq recommends the use of NCL to help ver-
ify connectivity.

                                31

 

In some cases, the PSDN supplier (or PTT) may impose restrictions, lim-
itations, or requirements on the proposed Compaq network configura-
tion. The customer must understand and adhere to these controls for
every network.

For installation of the X.25 software, the customer must:

o  Demonstrate equivalence of operation for modems other than Bell 208A,
   208B, 209, 212A synchronous modems, or in Europe, PTT approved modems.

o  Subscribe to the open user group and to at least two switched vir-
   tual circuits (SVCs) to complete the product's installation check-
   out (this test loops information from the X.25 native system to the
   PSDN and back to X.25 native system). Systems that use permanent
   virtual circuits (PVCs) or closed user groups only, or where the
   PSDN does not support calls to the same DTE address, require spe-
   cially negotiated arrangements for Compaq installation of the prod-
   uct.

Hardware Requirements

Refer to the OpenVMS Operating System for Alpha and VAX Software Prod-
uct Description (SPD 25.01.xx) for hardware requirements and proces-
sor support.

For general device or controller descriptions, refer to the Network-
ing Buyer's Guide.

Disk Space Requirements (Block Cluster Size = 1)

The following counts refer to the disk space required on the system
disk. The sizes are approximate; actual sizes may vary depending on
the user's system environment, configuration, and software options.







                                32

 

For OpenVMS VAX Systems

Disk space required for installation of base software: 85,000 blocks

Disk space required for installation of all optional software: 115,000
blocks

For WAN Device Drivers

Disk space required for installation: 5,000 blocks (2.5 MB)

The disk space required for permanent use depends on the number and
type of drivers installed, but should not exceed the space required
for installation.

For X.25 Software

Disk space required for installation: 8,000 blocks (4 MB)

Disk space required for use (permanent): 10,000 blocks (5 MB)

These counts refer to the disk space required on the system disk. The
sizes are approximate; actual sizes may vary depending on the user's
system environment, configuration, and software options.

Supported LAN Adapters

Refer to the OpenVMS Operating System for Alpha and VAX Software Prod-
uct Description (SPD 25.01.xx) for a list of supported LAN adapters.

Cluster Environment

The WAN device drivers are fully supported when installed on any valid
and licensed OpenVMS Cluster configuration. A device driver can only
be accessed from the system or node containing the communications de-
vice.

On common disks, to configure some product-specific attributes that
must remain unique to each system, certain components of the product
are stored in the system-specific environment (SYS$SPECIFIC: [SYSxxx])
of the VAX computer on which the installation is being performed. The

                                33

 

remaining components of the product, including some or all of the ex-
ecutable images, are installed common to all accessing VAX systems.

Though some or all of the product's executable images exist in the com-
mon system directory (SYS$COMMON: [SYS$LDR]) and are executable by all
VAX computers sharing this directory, it is essential that the prod-
uct be installed separately on all OpenVMS Cluster systems requiring
access to configure the product uniquely for each.

The same version of WAN device drivers must be used on all systems in
OpenVMS Cluster systems accessing a common disk and in local area Open-
VMS Cluster configurations.

Communications Devices

One of the communications devices listed in Table 2 is required for
use with X.25 native and WANDD.

o  The DSW21 and DSW41 (single line) and the DSW42 (dual line) are high-
   performance synchronous communications controllers for busless MicroVAX
   3100 and VAXstation 4000 systems. The communications controllers
   support DMA transfers for bit- and character-oriented protocols.
   The communications controller performs character transmission, re-
   ception, and framing in microcode.

o  The DPV11-DA or the DPV11-S (Q-bus) and DUP11 (UNIBUS) are char-
   acter interrupt devices for data link handling. CPU cycles are re-
   quired for data link level protocol processing and for each char-
   acter sent and received.

o  The DSV11 is a dual-line synchronous communications device for all
   Q-bus systems. The DSV11 supports DMA transfers for bit- and character-
   oriented protocols. The communications controller performs char-
   acter transmission, reception, and framing in microcode.

o  The DSF32 (MI-bus) is a multifunction device for VAXft fault tol-
   erant systems. The DSF32 provides a dual-line synchronous capabil-
   ity and supports DMA transfers for bit- and character-oriented pro-
   tocols. The communications controller performs character transmis-
   sion, reception, and framing in microcode. You can use the two lines
   independently to run different protocols or to provide a failover
   capability between lines in the event of an application or system
   failure.

o  The DMB32 (BI-bus) and the DMF32 (UNIBUS) are multifunction devices
   that include a single DMA line. The communications controllers per-
   form character transmission, reception, and framing in microcode.

o  The DSB32 (BI-bus) is a dual-line synchronous communications de-
   vice for VAXBI systems. The DSB32 supports DMA transfers for bit-
   and character-oriented protocols. The communications controller
   performs character transmission, reception, and framing in microcode.

Notes:

o  The DSH32 and DST32 are not supported on VAXstation 2000 and VAXs-
   tation 3100 systems.

                                35

 

o  The DSB32 is not supported for use on the VAX 7000 or VAX 10000 sys-
   tems.

o  The DSB32 is not supported for use on a VAX 6600 with extended ad-
   dressing (>512 MB of physical memory) enabled.

o  The DMB32, DMF32, and DSH32 are multifunction devices. Only the de-
   vice driver for the synchronous ports are included in the DECnet-
   Plus kit.

o  The DMB32 must be revision J or later for applications using GEN-
   BYTE, HDLC, or SDLC protocols.

o  The DMF32 must be revision J of later for applications using HDLC
   protocol and revision M is required for simultaneous operation of
   the printer port.

o  The DMB32 only supports a synchronous line speed of 19.2 Kb/s if
   any asynchronous lines are in use. The DMB32 is also supported on
   VAX 7000 and VAX 10000 systems configured with extended address-
   ing, (32-bit physical addresses).

o  The DMF32 is supported on a VAXBI system fitted with a DWBUA UNIBUS
   adapter for DDCMP and GENBYTE protocol use only.

o  The DSH32 running the DDCMP protocol only supports a single line
   at 9.6 Kb/s on a MicroVAX 2000. Running the BISYNC protocol, it only
   supports a single line at 4.8 Kb/s on a MicroVAX 2000.

o  The DSV11, DSW42, and the DSB32 support the use of different pro-
   tocols on each of the two lines of the device.

o  The DUP11 is supported on a VAXBI system fitted with a DWBUA UNIBUS
   adapter for VAX 8200, VAX 8250, VAX 8300, VAX 8300, VAX 8350, VAX
   8500, VAX 8530, VAX 8550, VAX 8700, and VAX 8800 systems only.

All the WAN device drivers included with DECnet-Plus offer support for
a user ($QIO) interface. Table 3 lists the device driver character-
istics and indicates the maximum permitted line speeds for each of the
line protocols supported by the individual drivers.

Note: Where two line speeds are shown, for example 256/64, the higher
speed refers to single line operation of the device while the lower
speed refers to dual line operation of the device.

The WAN device drivers included with DECnet-Plus also provide a pseu-
dodriver (WANDRIVER) that provides a programming interface to the data
link level for the LAPB, DEC-HDLC, and DDCMP protocols.

The device drivers all support full-duplex and half-duplex operation,
where appropriate to the protocol. DDCMP and SDLC device drivers sup-
port both point-to-point and multipoint tributary operation. "BISYNC"

                                37

 

refers to the IBM implementation of bisynchronous protocol. The GEN-
BYTE protocol is a general byte-oriented protocol for use with user-
written framing routines, is supported by the DMB32 and the DMF32 de-
vice drivers.

The maximum permitted line speed depends on the line interface stan-
dard used and must not exceed 19.2 Kb/s for an RS232 V.24 interface.
There may be additional line speed restrictions for other line inter-
face standards. Refer to the Software Product Descriptions for the syn-
chronous interfaces for more information.

Other Compaq communications layered products may not necessarily sup-
port operation of the synchronous interface at the maximum line speed
supported by the device driver. Refer to the appropriate Software Prod-
uct Description for the Compaq communications layered product for pre-
cise details of supported configurations.

In all cases, throughput over synchronous lines is dependent on the
user application and system environment.

The WAN device drivers all support modem control signal operation. Re-
fer to the Software Product Descriptions for the appropriate synchronous
interface for details of the modem signals supported by an individ-
ual interface.

Optional Hardware

Additional communications device(s) subject to the limitations described
in Table 3 of this SPD are required.

Table 5 describes the physical hardware configurations supported by
X.25 in terms of CPU type and communication interface. It is assumed
that there are 128 bytes of user data per packet in an X.25 native mode
configuration where data is being sent and received at maximum speeds
in both directions. This table indicates the maximum load for certain
VAX processors supported at the time of publication.

The numbers given in the table are load costs. Load costs indicate the
overhead of full-duplex packet transfer at the indicated speed. The
load units are calculated for an application that does no work with
transmitted/received data, and indicate a maximum packet rate for that
configuration. An idle device incurs negligible load. Systems should
be configured to sustain peak load rates.

Factors to Consider

                                44

 

Other factors to consider when configuring hardware devices for use
with X.25 on a given processor are:

o  Hardware configuration limits, such as power supply, backplane space,
   bus throughput and mapping registers available, and any other re-
   strictions on the number of devices per CPU or per bus must be ob-
   served.

o  Actual/average packet size in bytes - Generally, doubling the ac-
   tual packet size will halve the load units consumed for direct mem-
   ory access (DMA) devices, but increase the load units for character-
   interrupt devices by approximately 30 percent.

o  Table 5 assumes that data is sent and received in each direction
   of a full-duplex line in equal ratio. If the number of X.25 pack-
   ets per second is predominantly one-way, the load units per line
   can be reduced proportionately up to a factor of 50 percent.

The maximum system configuration with a mix of device types is com-
puted by adding the load costs (in load units) for each device up to
the limit for a given processor type. Table 6 lists the load units for
devices at various speeds.

Example 1:

A VAX 8500 computer is being used to process X.25 native mode commu-
nications. If the system uses one line of a DSB32 at 192 Kb/s and a
DMB32 at 19.2 Kb/s, the load unit total is 156. Assuming these devices
are fully active, they will consume 156/360 = 43% of the CPU for com-
munications processing. It is inadvisable to add more devices to this
CPU, unless it is dedicated to the task of communications processing.

Example 2:

When one line of a DSV11 is fully used on a MicroVAX 3800 at 64 Kb/s,
it consumes 120/390 = 31% of the processor in processing X.25 commu-
nications.

Appendix A: File Transfer, Access, and Management (FTAM)

FTAM software provides communications for the following file opera-
tions between open systems:

o  Copying files between local and remote systems

o  Appending, deleting, or renaming files

o  Displaying information about files

An open system is a computer system that implements the standards for
each of the seven layers of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) Ref-
erence Model for communications as defined by the International Or-
ganization for Standardization. An FTAM system is any open system con-
taining an FTAM implementation that conforms to the FTAM standard and
includes the implementations of the necessary underlying OSI services.

FTAM implements several standards that define the following components
of these layers of the OSI Basic Reference Model: the FTAM service el-
ement and the Association Control Service Element (ACSE) of the Ap-
plication layer, the Presentation layer, and the Session layer.

Supported Standards

FTAM conforms to the following OSI standards:

o  ISO 8571 - File Transfer, Access, and Management service and pro-
   tocol

o  ISO 8650 - ACSE protocol

o  ISO 8823 - Presentation protocol

o  ISO 8327 - Session protocol

Table 7 compares the supported implementation profiles for different
standards bodies and their relationship to each other.

FTAM Component Software

The component software includes the user facilities (initiators), re-
sponders, management tools, and problem determination tools.

FTAM User Facilities

Users access the FTAM user facilities by entering the following Open-
VMS operating system commands: APPEND, COPY, DIRECTORY, RENAME, and
DELETE. These commands operate on files stored on any FTAM system whose
implementations are compatible with FTAM. You cannot use these com-
mands to manipulate files directly on your local system.

Support for Any File-Naming Convention

A file designation is system-specific information that identifies a
file to its storage system. FTAM software lets users specify files us-
ing the naming conventions of the systems where the files reside. FTAM
supports the OpenVMS operating system RMS format for file specifica-
tions and a comparable style of file-specification format that accom-
modates non-RMS file designations.




                                53

 

Support for Several File Types

FTAM software can access and transfer files containing both binary and
ASCII data. FTAM-1, FTAM-2, FTAM-3, and NBS-9 document types are sup-
ported.

FTAM-1 files are unstructured text files, FTAM-2 files are sequential
text files, and FTAM-3 files are unstructured binary files. Table 8
shows the parameters supported by FTAM-1, FTAM-2, and FTAM-3 document
types.

Flexible and Transparent Access for Local Files

FTAM software treats local files the same way that the OpenVMS oper-
ating system file system treats them.

File Transfers

The FTAM COPY command transfers files between compatible FTAM systems
without modifying the source file. The facility can transfer files in
either direction between the local system and a remote FTAM system.
The COPY command can also transfer files between two remote FTAM sys-
tems for a local FTAM user.

The COPY command also allows you to append one or more files to a sin-
gle output file within or between FTAM systems.

FTAM-DAP Gateway

The FTAM-DAP Gateway lets you perform file operations from a non-OSI
system that supports the DAP protocol to an OSI system supporting FTAM.
Remote users of the gateway need not establish accounts on the gate-
way system to use its capabilities. The gateway does not support the
APPEND functionality.

















                                55

 

File Deletion

The FTAM DELETE command lets you delete one or more files on any com-
bination of FTAM systems provided you have delete access to those files
on the specific FTAM system.

Renaming Requests

The FTAM RENAME command allows you to rename files. The command works
on files stored on remote FTAM systems (remote files). The command en-
ables you to change the path name or file name of an existing file.
For remote files, you must specify whatever type of information the
remote FTAM system requires for specifying files.

Directory Requests

The FTAM DIRECTORY command lets you display the complete set of FTAM
file attributes. Specific options allow you to vary the display of at-
tributes that are meaningful in an OpenVMS operating system environ-
ment, for example, date and time of the last modification of file name.

FTAM File Error Recovery

FTAM provides file error recovery functionality, both in the COPY ini-
tiator command and in the FTAM responder. File error recovery is pro-
vided for classes 1, 2, and 3 errors as detailed in ISO 8571-4.

Class 1 file error recovery provides only the restart functionality,
while classes 2 and 3 provide both the restart and recovery function-
ality as follows:

o  If an internal error is detected in the data transfer regime, class
   1 recovery restarts the data transfer regime by retransmitting the
   file data beginning at the negotiated checkpoint within the data
   transfer regime.

o  Class 2 error recovery provides for the re-establishment of the se-
   lect and open regimes, and also allows for the retransmission of
   file data beginning at a negotiated checkpoint within the data trans-
   fer regime.

                                56

 

o  Class 3 error recovery provides full recovery by re-establishing
   a lost FTAM association and its select and open regimes. Class 3
   recovery then restarts the data transfer regime by retransmitting
   the file data beginning at the negotiated checkpoint within the data
   transfer regime.

All restart and recovery operations and procedures are completely trans-
parent to the user.
































                                57

 

Management and Problem Determination Tools

FTAM software supplies a number of management tools, including an in-
stallation verification procedure (IVP), a tracing utility, event log-
ging, and informational and error messages.

FTAM Installation Verification Procedure (IVP)

The FTAM IVP sets up outbound and inbound application associations.
A connection is made to your local system (as a loopback test). The
FTAM IVP checks that your installation is able to set up and release
presentation and session connections. It tests the FTAM software by
starting a responder and reading the attributes of a file with the DI-
RECTORY command.

FTAM Tracing Utility

The FTAM tracing utility (OSITRACE) is a tool for identifying prob-
lems in protocol exchanges between your local system and any remote
FTAM system. The tracing utility captures protocol exchanges and tran-
scribes them into easily read text; OSITRACE data is written to SYS$OUTPUT.

The FTAM tracing utility monitors data exchanges for individual as-
sociations. The tracing utility can trace data originating from the
following components: FTAM (DATA, PROTOCOL, and STRUCTURING), ACSE,
Presentation, and Session.

OSI Address Lookup Using X.500

The FTAM software is capable of retrieving network addresses from the
X.500 directory. You can use this functionality with or instead of re-
trieving addresses from a local repository.

FTAM Event Logging

For event logging, the FTAM responder writes records to OSIF$RESPONDER.LOG.




                                58

 

Requirements for Compatibility with FTAM

FTAM lets an open system perform a specific set of file transfer, ac-
cess, and management activities with any open system having a compat-
ible FTAM implementation.

The Protocol Implementation Conformance Statement (PICS) provides more
information about Compaq's FTAM implementation.

Appendix B: Virtual Terminal

DECnet-Plus Virtual Terminal (VT) is Compaq Computer Corporation's im-
plementation of the ISO Virtual Terminal Basic Class standard, which
consists of the service definition (ISO 9040) and the protocol (ISO
9041). VT software adheres to these standards, thereby providing in-
teractive access between DECnet-Plus systems and other multivendor ter-
minal systems and host systems that also adhere to the ISO Virtual Ter-
minal Basic Class standard.

VT is implemented as an Application Service Element (ASE) of the OSI
Application layer.

VT can run over Transport layer classes 0, 2 or 4 over CONS, and TP4
over CLNS. VT can also run over TCP/IP networks using RFC 1006.

VT provides terminal/initiator (for a local user) and host/responder
(for the remote user) capabilities. Terminal/responder and host/initiator
are not supported.

Supported Standards

VT conforms to the following OSI standards:

   ISO 9041 - Virtual Terminal protocol - basic class
   ISO 8650 - ACSE protocol
   ISO 8823 - Presentation protocol
   ISO 8327 - Session protocol

Virtual Terminal Features

Virtual Terminal supports the following features:

o  Basic class (character cell terminals) of service

o  Asynchronous mode (A-Mode) of operation

o  Online Help

OSI Address Lookup using X.500

The VT software is capable of retrieving network addresses from the
X.500 directory. You can use this functionality with or instead of re-
trieving addresses from a local repository.

Command Mode

Command mode allows you to execute commands that can modify the char-
acteristics of the Virtual Terminal association with the remote ap-
plication.

Trace Utility

The VT tracing utility (OSITRACE) is a tool for identifying problems
in protocol exchanges between your local system and any remote sys-
tem. The utility captures protocol exchanges and transcribes them into
easily read text.

The tracing utility monitors data exchanges for individual associa-
tions. The utility can trace data originating from the VT, ACSE, Pre-
sentation, and Session components.

FTAM API

The FTAM API supports the OSI standard ISO 8571: Information Process-
ing Systems, Open Systems Interconnection, and File Transfer, Access,
and Management.

The FTAM API provides the interface to the FTAM protocol machine pro-
vided in DECnet-Plus. Communications between the application code and
the FTAM protocol machine are carried out using ASN.1 encoded data struc-
tures. The API supports the following functions:

   Abort
   Begin-Group

   ement

The OSAK API provides the interface to the ACSE services. It provides
the following services:

   Associate
   Release
   Abort
   Redirect

The redirect service is not an ACSE service. The service allows ap-
plications to redirect an incoming association to another process on
the local system.

The OSAK API also includes support for the OSI Presentation layer with
support for the following OSI standards:

o  ISO 8823: Information Processing Systems, Open Systems Intercon-
   nection, Connection-Oriented Presentation Protocol Specification

The OSAK API also supports (by pass through) the OSI Session layer ser-
vices.

Session Layer API

The Session layer API, called the OSAK Session Programming Interface
(SPI), supports the following OSI standards:

o  ISO 8327: Information Processing Systems, Open Systems Intercon-
   nection, Basic Connection Oriented Session Protocol Specification

o  ISO 8326: Information Processing Systems, Open Systems Intercon-
   nection, Basic Connection Oriented Session Service Definition.

Support for the OSAK SPI interface is limited to Version 3.0. The OSAK
Version 1.1 SPI interface is no longer supported.

The Session layer supports ISO Session version 1 and version 2. Ses-
sion version 1 allows up to 512 octets of user data on a service. Ses-
sion version 2 supports the restrictions imposed by the National In-
stitute of Standards and Technology allowing up to 10,240 octets of
data on a service.

Compaq DECnet-Plus for OpenVMS Version 7.3 includes Version 3.0 of the
OSAK SPI. Users of the OSAK SPI Version 1.1 should upgrade to Version
3.0.

                                64

 

The OSAK API provides the interface to the following connect and re-
lease services:
