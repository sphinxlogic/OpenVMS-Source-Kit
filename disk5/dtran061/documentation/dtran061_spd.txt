PRODUCT NAME: DEC DATATRIEVE/Hangul for OpenVMS         SPD 25.H2.02
              Version 6.1



DESCRIPTION

DEC DATATRIEVE/Hangul for OpenVMS, hereinafter referred to as DEC
DTR/Hangul or the 'Software Product', is the Korean version of the DEC
DATATRIEVE product.  DEC DTR/Hangul is a query, report and data
management system for the OpenVMS/Hangul Operating System, and is an
upward compatible version of DEC DATATRIEVE extended to support Korean.
In this Software Product Description, description of product
functionalities that support processing of English data in general,
together with a list of specific functionalities that have been extended
to support processing of Korean data are provided.

The Software Product provides a uniform access method for data stored by
RMS and DEC Rdb/Hangul on OpenVMS, and data residing in other databases
accessible by the Rdb Access products.  Using DEC DTR/Hangul, novice or
experienced users can retrieve or modify data without considering the
underlying storage method or physical location.


Modes of Operation

DEC DTR/Hangul presents information in several different formats.
Information can be displayed using simple defaults or can be reported
through a more flexible report writer.  Information can be displayed on a
terminal or workstation, printed on a hard-copy device, or written to a
file.  Information can also be displayed with user-defined DEC FMS/Hangul
and VAX TDMS forms, as well as with DECforms/Hangul or presented graphically.  
Graphics output is REGIS; it can be managed by devices or converters accepting 
REGIS.  

DEC DTR/Hangul can be used interactively to retrieve, modify, store or
delete data using a simple set of commands.  Frequently used combinations
of commands can be stored as named procedures and invoked by names.
Programs written in other DEC programming languages can call DEC
DTR/Hangul, allowing them to be independent of underlying data storage
methods and physical location.

                                                                  ASIA REGION




Data Dictionary

DEC DTR/Hangul is dictionary driven.  Data descriptions are stored in and
retrieved from the CDD/Repository for OpenVMS.  DEC DTR/Hangul includes
commands to store, examine, modify and delete definitions in the
CDD/Repository for OpenVMS, and can use definitions stored by other VAX
layered products, such as DEC Rdb/Hangul for OpenVMS database definition.


Protection

Protection is handled by the CDD/Repository for OpenVMS.  DEC DTR/Hangul
can access data only through definitions in the CDD/Repository for
OpenVMS.  Locking the definition prevents the user from accessing the
data.  Access control can be based on name, login account, password or
terminal class (local, remote, or dial-up).


Remote Data Access

DEC DTR/Hangul provides access to data on remote VAX or PDP-11 systems,
provided that DATATRIEVE has been installed on the remote system.  DEC
DTR/Hangul uses the local data dictionary on the remote node, and divides
processing between the host and the remote system to minimize traffic
over the communications link.


For the Nonprogrammer

DEC DTR/Hangul provides a novice user with a tutorial mode, called GUIDE
Mode.

DEC DTR/Hangul offers ADT, the Application Design Tool, for more
experienced users who want to define their own data structures.  ADT
takes the users step-by-step through the definition of a domain based on
an RMS data file.

If DEC DTR/Hangul is used on the same information by experienced and
novice users, the novice user can use the full power of the language by
invoking procedures designed by the more experienced user.


For the Programmer

DEC DTR/Hangul is a highly structured language that provides automatic
access optimization, data type conversion and data validation.  Looping
and control structures, such as IF THEN ELSE, BEGIN END, REPEAT, WHILE,
CHOICE and FOR (each record), can be combined and nested to create
complex, powerful commands.

DEC DTR/Hangul responds to programming errors with clear, explicit error
messages.  A user can issue an EDIT command to invoke a text editor with
the erroneous statement as input text, correct the mistake, and resubmit
the command.  This editor can be either HEDT, HTPU, EDT, TPU or DEC
Language-Sensitive Editor (LSE), and is controlled by a user logical name
assignment.


Data Definition

DEC DTR/Hangul stores the fixed attributes of each record in the record
definition.  In addition to COBOL-like attributes, DTR/Hangul accepts
validation criteria, fields whose values are computed at run-time,
missing value expressions, and default values.

DEC DTR/Hangul supports most data types used by DEC FORTRAN, DEC COBOL,
VAX PL/I, DEC C and VAX BASIC.

DEC DTR/Hangul also supports Varying String and Segmented String data
types in DEC Rdb/Hangul for OpenVMS databases.


Views

A VIEW is an alternative description of data.  It can restrict a user by
including only some of the data items in a record, or it can combine data
items from several files.  Information can be linked through common
values (or set linkages in DEC DBMS) to produce complex hierarchical
structures.  Using a predefined VIEW, a user can access and display data
from several files at once with the same commands used on a single file.
Data accessed through a VIEW can be printed and modified, but data cannot
be stored or erased using a VIEW.


Program Access

DEC DTR/Hangul can be called from any language that supports the VMS
calling standard.  DEC DTR/Hangul automatically converts data from its
storage format to the format expected by the program.  All of the
features of interactive DEC DTR/Hangul are available through the call
interface and use the same syntax.


Storage Methods

DEC DTR/Hangul uses a single, consistent syntax to provide access to
information stored in RMS for OpenVMS sequential or indexed files (RMS
relative files are supported for queries only), DEC DBMS and DEC
Rdb/Hangul databases.  DEC DTR/Hangul can also provide read-only access
to information stored in certain IBM mainframe databases through the use
of VIDA for DB2 [TM], as well as ORACLE [R] on OpenVMS through Rdb
Access.  Data from all these sources can be combined into a single VIEW.
Refer to SPD 25.44.xx for the availability of Rdb Access and VIDA.

If access to a DEC DBMS database involves explicit set walking, or if
records must be manually connected or disconnected from sets, a user can
employ DEC DTR/Hangul language features that are specific to DEC DBMS
access.  However, if the user employs VIEWS or implicit set walking, DEC
DTR/Hangul can access information in DEC DBMS databases using the same
syntax used for data from an RMS file.



Report Generation

The DEC DTR/Hangul REPORT statement produces simple formatted reports
without formatting statements.  It also allows a user to override the
default format when more complex reports are required.  Reports can
either be page-based, printable documents, or table-based formatted data
that can be input by a spreadsheet.

Column headers and, in page-based reports, page headers containing title,
date, and page numbers are produced automatically.  Simple statements (AT
TOP, AT BOTTOM) create page headers and trailers for controlling breaks,
page breaks, or a report summary.  DEC DATATRIEVE provides all of its
statistical functions and value expressions within the REPORT statement.

Reports can be output in a variety of output formats: table reports are
produced in DTIF format, and page-based reports in DDIF, PostScript [R]
and Text formats.  Usage of DDIF and Postscript allows a variety of text
attributes (size, font types, rendition) to be applied to any part of the
report to obtain a boardroom-quality output.  These attributes, and other
printing characteristics such as page size and orientation, can be
selected from DEC DATATRIEVE through simple statements without requiring
the use of a graphical terminal.  Simple character-cell-based reports are
also available using the Text format.  Using the CDA converter library,
DTIF and DDIF reports can be converted to a variety of output formats,
allowing interoperability with a number of popular applications.

The Report Writer provides two layout tools: a grid printout of the CDA
report layout with placement of rows and columns, including those with
varying font types, and a graphical printout of the layout page, with
placement of the different report objects (such as header, footer, body).

Reports can be generated from data stored in DEC RMS files, DEC DBMS and
DEC Rdb/VMS databases, certain IBM mainframe databases accessed through
the use of VIDA for DB2 or DATATRIEVE VIEWS that combine any of these
without any change in the syntax of the REPORT statement.


Graphics

DEC DTR/Hangul includes a number of predefined plots invoked with a
single command that takes standard record selection expressions as
arguments, and creates bar, pie, line and scattered point plots of the
information selected.  Plots can be displayed on DIGITAL graphics
terminals, such as VT340 (See OPTIONAL HARDWARE section for a list of
specific supported terminals).  Hard copies can be obtained from
terminals by attaching a DIGITAL device which supports the SIXEL protocol
(e.g. LA50, LA75).  For users of DECwindows, graphics can be displayed in
DECterm windows.

Compatibility

DEC DTR/Hangul is fully compatible with DEC DATATRIEVE and largely
upward compatible from DATATRIEVE-11.  A utility is provided to extract
the contents of a DATATRIEVE-11 dictionary in a format to be entered into
CDD/Repository for OpenVMS.  Some syntactic and semantic differences do
exist between DATATRIEVE-11 and DEC DTR/Hangul.  Procedures copies with
the EXTRACT utility may require modification.
