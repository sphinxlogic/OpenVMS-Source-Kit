          PRODUCT NAME: OpenVMS/Thai VAX Operating System, Versi  SPD 26.C7.09





          DESCRIPTION

          OpenVMS/Thai VAX operating system Version 7.1 is an   extension
          to   OpenVMS   operating   system   Version 7.1 to provide a
          computing environment in both English and Thai languages.  While
          keeping full compatibility with OpenVMS, OpenVMS/Thai VAX extends
          and enhances the system utilities and environment of OpenVMS to
          process Thai characters.  Thai language specific utilities are
          included to address special  requirements  which  are  not
          provided  in  OpenVMS VAX.  In addition, OpenVMS/Thai VAX forms
          the base platform for Thai language application development.

          OpenVMS/Thai VAX supports Thai data representation that conforms
          to the Thai Industrial Standard 620-2533 (TIS 620-2533) of the
          Thai Industrial Standards Institute, Ministry of Industry,
          defined in 2533 (1990).
