 PRODUCT NAME:  MicroVAX/DRQ3B Device Driver, Version 1.4        SPD
 29.25.05

 DESCRIPTION

 The MicroVAX/DRQ3B Device Driver V1.4 (HXDRIVER) supports the DRQ3B
 interface, which is a general purpose 16 bit parallel interface be-
 tween the MicroVAX Q-bus and a user's peripheral. The DRQ3B, under driver
 control, is capable of performing double buffered direct memory ac-
 cess (DMA) using the block mode capabilities of the Q-bus to provide
 high bandwidth data transfers. The DRQ3B interface also has 512 word
 FIFO (First In, First Out) buffers on both the input and output ports
 to allow data to be transferred while an interrupt service routine is
 setting up the next buffer.

 Driver Features

 o  Double buffering of I/O requests

 o  Buffer termination via an external event (EOP)

 o  External interrupt

 o  Function bit setting/clearing

 o  DMA operations directly to Q-bus memory

 o  Error handling

 Double Buffering of I/O Requests

 As long as two or more buffers are queued to the driver it will au-
 tomatically try to double buffer the I/O requests. A function modi-
 fier IO$M_HX_HOLD_DMA allows an application to queue up multiple buffers
 before starting I/O, so that all of those queued buffers can be dou-
 ble buffered.

 Buffer Termination Via an External Event (EOP)

                               DIGITAL                      May 1994

                                                         AE-KV48F-TE

 

 The hardware has a line on the input connector that is handled like
 a 17th data bit but will cause a DMA operation to terminate and a new
 one to start when asserted and read out of the FIFO by the DMA con-
 troller. The driver supports this condition and returns the number of
 words transferred including the last one transferred with the exter-
 nal event asserted as well as the success code SS$_WASSET rather than
 the conventional SS$_NORMAL so that an application can test for the
 occurrence of this condition.

 External Interrupt

 A line separate from the external event line allows an interrupt to
 be generated. The driver allows the detection of this condition in an
 AST routine.

 Function Bit Setting/Clearing

 The driver provides SETMODE functions that will set/clear the func-
 tion bits for a given port, and allows the function bits to be read
 with a SENSEMODE function.

 DMA Operations Directly to Q-bus Memory

 The driver supports two forms of I/O, logical and physical.

 o  Physical I/O transfers allow the transfer of data directly to Q-bus
    memory and specialized I/O subsystems such as those found in some
    types of array processors.

 o  The driver also allows MicroVAX memory to be used for physical I/O
    transfers to reduce overhead.

 o  Logical I/O supports the more traditional mechanisms for perform-
    ing DMA. As a result, it is easier to program but is a little less
    efficient.

 Error Handling

 The driver will report nonexistent memory conditions (NXMs), FIFO over-
 runs and FIFO underruns in case the interface logic stops handshak-
 ing correctly.
