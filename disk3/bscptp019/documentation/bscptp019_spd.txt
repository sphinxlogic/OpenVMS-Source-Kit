          PRODUCT NAME:  2780/3780 Protocol Emulator for OpenVMS[TM] VAX[TM], SPD
          25.07.19                Version 1.9

          DESCRIPTION

          The Compaq 2780/3780 Protocol Emulator (PE) for OpenVMS VAX emulates
          the synchronous line protocol used by an IBM 2780 or 3780 remote batch
          terminal. The emulator provides the OpenVMS user with a mechanism for
          transferring data between the host operating system and another sys-
          tem equipped to handle 2780 or 3780 communications protocols.

          The emulator can be invoked interactively or via a command procedure.
          The emulator's command set is designed to let several users share a
          communication line. With the appropriate modem options, the emulator
          is capable of automatically answering incoming calls.

          Sophisticated operations can be performed by a combination of command
          procedures, allowing, for example, unattended operation. Unattended
          operations include the ability to detect an incoming call, to estab-
          lish the connection, and then to transmit, and to receive files and
          recover from transmission failures, all without the intervention of
          an operator.

          The PE supports several data formats; a particular format is selected
          via a user's command. Users can select various control translation schemes,
          variable record lengths or card images, ASCII EBCDIC translation, and
          BSC transparency. The OpenVMS record management facility performs all
          file I/O. Data can be sent to files representing print and punch streams;
          the format of files sent to one "stream" can differ from the format
          sent to the other "stream."



                                                                   April 2001
