PRODUCT NAME:  Compaq Advanced Server V7.3A for OpenVMS

DESCRIPTION

Compaq Advanced Server for OpenVMS is an OpenVMS layered application
providing a network operating system that is compatible with the Mi-
crosoft networking technology. In particular, the Advanced Server for
OpenVMS is based on the Windows NT Server, but it provides additional
features. It enhances the Windows NT Server functionality by incor-
porating both OpenVMS and Microsoft technology to deliver powerful fea-
tures for network administration and enhanced security. It combines
the networking strengths and rich application set of Windows NT with
the proven availability, reliability, scalability, and security of Open-
VMS. The Advanced Server for OpenVMS can operate independently from
or in cooperation with the Windows NT Server, or with a Windows 2000
Server.

The Advanced Server for OpenVMS software evolved from the PATHWORKS
V6 for OpenVMS (Advanced Server) product to provide tighter integra-
tion with the OpenVMS operating system and the enhanced Windows NT in-
tegration features introduced with OpenVMS Alpha Version 7.2.

Advanced Server for OpenVMS supports Extended File Specifications based
on OpenVMS ODS-5 disk volumes. The server product supports long names
and deep directories, certain Unicode or extended character-set char-
acters, the OpenVMS Registry (based on the Windows NT registry), COM
for OpenVMS, and other capabilities that integrate Windows NT and Open-
VMS environments. (The ODS-2 file system continues to be supported.)
As a result, the Advanced Server for OpenVMS takes advantage of the
OpenVMS operating system's native ability to function simultaneously
as a file, print, communications, and applications server while en-
suring compatibility with Microsoft networking features and interop-
erability with Microsoft desktop environments. DOS, Windows, Windows
NT, Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows 2000, Windows XP Professional, and
OpenVMS users can share files and printers over the network.



                                 2

 

As a server for workstations on a network, the Advanced Server for Open-
VMS provides file and print shares that enable a community of desk-
top users to share computing resources efficiently. The Advanced Server
for OpenVMS can function as a simple file and print server for a small,
isolated community of users or as the foundation of a large network
distributed over a wide geographical area.

Desktop and OpenVMS users can share printers connected to Alpha com-
puters or to OpenVMS Cluster systems, as well as network-based print-
ers such as LAT printers and PrintServers. The Advanced Server for Open-
VMS gives you the option of configuring the server to allow manage-
ment of shared printers from Windows NT, thereby allowing you to take
advantage of the features provided by Windows NT print services.

FEATURES

The Advanced Server for OpenVMS adds an additional dimension to general-
purpose OpenVMS systems. Along with providing traditional support for
business, scientific, and engineering applications, the server allows
an OpenVMS operating system to appear to PC clients as a Windows NT
Server.

The major features of the Advanced Server for OpenVMS are described
in the following sections.

File Services

The Advanced Server for OpenVMS provides clients with a remote file
system that appears as a transparent extension of the client system's
local computing environment.

The Advanced Server lets users share OpenVMS files. The Advanced Server
file shares are based on Microsoft's Advanced Server V3.0 SMB (Server
Message Block) protocols. You can use discretionary Windows NT access
controls on each file and directory to specify the groups and users
that can access files, to define the levels of access that each group
or user is permitted, and to control auditing supported by Windows NT-
like security. Additional, optional security is provided by OpenVMS
file and directory protections.

                                 3

 

Each file stored in a file service is stored as an OpenVMS file in Record
Management Services (RMS) format. Four types of RMS file or record for-
mats are allowed and supported on each volume:

o  Sequential stream

o  Sequential stream_LF

o  Sequential fixed-length record (512 bytes per record)

o  Sequential undefined

The Advanced Server for OpenVMS now provides improved performance for
access of sequential and VFC (variable length with fixed-length con-
trol) files. In previous versions of the Advanced Server, and on ODS-
2 volumes, the file has to be read completely to determine the cor-
rect file size. The Advanced Server now supports file-size calcula-
tions for RMS sequential and VFC files on ODS-5 volumes. This reduces
the number of I/Os and the file-open time when the Advanced Server opens
a file for the first time.

Multiple clients can concurrently access files stored on the server's
disk through the file-access modes and byte-range locking support pro-
vided by the Advanced Server. In addition, opportunistic locking al-
lows clients to lock files and cache data locally without risk of an-
other user changing the file; this provides performance improvements
and reduces network traffic related to client/server communication.

Note: The Advanced Server does not support concurrent simultaneous ac-
cess to files by OpenVMS processes and the Advanced Server processes.

Files stored in a file service are accessible to PC clients, to Open-
VMS users, and to applications that can interpret the content and or-
ganization of a file written by the client application.

The Advanced Server for OpenVMS ensures compatibility with a wide va-
riety of clients and legacy applications attempting to share server
resources. Some of the Advanced Server for OpenVMS features that help
ensure such compatibility include:

o  Extended File Specifications

                                 4

 

Extended File Specifications, based on ODS-5, includes support for deep
directories and extended file names.

o  Unicode characters or extended character sets

The Advanced Server for OpenVMS file server can now allow certain Uni-
code characters and extended character sets that are foreign to the
Western European languages, making available a broader set of char-
acters not only for file and share names, but also for other objects
manageable by the Advanced Server, such as user names and group names.
The Advanced Server for OpenVMS provides six additional character sets
with the potential of supporting over 40 different languages. Though
you can configure any one of these languages, Compaq has tested and
officially supports the following languages:

   o  English (USA)

   o  Hebrew

By giving you a choice of languages, the Advanced Server for OpenVMS
can enable you to configure the server to the local language of the
server's users. Most of the Western European languages support the Euro
currency symbol.

o  Legacy applications with more restrictive file-naming conventions

Some legacy applications (such as MS-DOS) are more restrictive than
the Advanced Server, Windows NT, and other systems, in both the length
of file names and in the set of valid characters supported for file
names. As a result, these applications cannot take full advantage of
the capabilities of the OpenVMS ODS-5 disk volume and longer file names
supported on the other systems. To enable compatibility with these ap-
plications, the Advanced Server for OpenVMS automatically creates
MS-DOS-compatible alias file names for files whose names do not com-
ply with the file-naming standards of those applications. As a result,
client applications that either must use or choose to use the MS-DOS
format for file names can access these shared files on the server by
using the file's associated alias name.


                                 5

 

Print Shares

The Advanced Server for OpenVMS software lets DOS, Windows, Windows
NT, Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows 2000, Windows XP Professional, and
OpenVMS users share printers connected to Alpha computers or OpenVMS
Cluster systems - as well as network-based printers such as LAT print-
ers and PrintServers. Print shares are supported in local area net-
work (LAN) and wide area network (WAN) environments. PC clients can
print files from their desktop operating systems as well as from PC
applications.

Multiple print shares can be defined for a single printer. For exam-
ple, separate services can be created for landscape-mode printing and
portrait-mode printing. Similarly, separate services can be created
for DIGITAL mode and IBM ProPrinter mode printing for a single LA75
printer.

The Advanced Server for OpenVMS supports all PostScript printers sup-
ported by OpenVMS. Selected PostScript printers may need the DECprint
Supervisor for OpenVMS (DCPS) software to provide access through the
OpenVMS queuing system over TCP/IP or DECnet. The DECprint Supervi-
sor for OpenVMS (DCPS) product provides PostScript and DEC ANSI print-
ing to selected industry-standard PostScript printers.

By default, you manage shared printers using the Advanced Server for
OpenVMS ADMINISTER command-line interface. However, the Advanced Server
for OpenVMS gives you the option of configuring the server to support
management of shared printers from Windows NT, using the Windows NT
print services. Whichever style of management you choose, you have full
functionality only from the style chosen - you cannot have full man-
agement functionality with both. Advantages of the Windows NT style
of management include:

o  Simple management of Advanced Server shared printers by using the
   Windows NT print services dialog boxes.

o  When adding a printer to the Advanced Server, the Windows NT Add
   Printer Wizard installs the required drivers for the printer on the
   server; these drivers are provided by the administrator (such as
   from the Windows NT installation CD-ROM). When a client is set up

                                 6

 

   to use the printer, these drivers are available for downloading.
   When new drivers are distributed, administrators have to update a
   single location only.

o  Use of Windows NT access permissions for Advanced Server shared print-
   ers.

Before considering whether to take advantage of this feature, consult
the latest Advanced Server for OpenVMS Release Notes.

Sharing of Network Resources by Heterogeneous Users

Services provided by Advanced Server are accessible to PATHWORKS clients
as well as to Microsoft clients. All clients using the services of the
Advanced Server for OpenVMS must be properly licensed. (For more in-
formation, see the section SOFTWARE LICENSING.)

Files are stored on the server in native OpenVMS RMS format. This al-
lows information stored by the PCs using Advanced Server to be shared
with traditional OpenVMS users. In addition, this feature allows in-
formation to be shared among all clients.

Network Transports

Advanced Server for OpenVMS supports DECnet (Phase IV) and DECnet-Plus
(formerly known as DECnet/OSI) transport software as supported by Open-
VMS Alpha Version 7.2-2, 7.3, and 7.3-1. The server also supports TCP/IP
and NetBEUI network transport software. One or more transport stacks
can work concurrently on the server.

Both the TCP/IP and DECnet transports are sold as separate Compaq prod-
ucts and require separate licenses.

NetBEUI transport software is included with the Advanced Server soft-
ware. Using NetBEUI transport software, clients can access the server
in the LAN for file and print shares. NetBEUI is recommended for use
in small LAN-only environments of 50 nodes or less.

For information on supported network transport software, see the sec-
tion SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS.

                                 7

 

NetBIOS Interface

The Advanced Server supports the NetBIOS interface in TCP/IP, DECnet,
and NetBEUI networks, using multiple transport stacks on a single con-
troller or on different network controllers. However, a NetBIOS pro-
gramming interface is not provided.

NetBIOS support under TCP/IP includes both a p-node and a b-node RFC
1001/1002 implementation. Therefore, the NetBIOS interface can be used
under TCP/IP in both LAN and WAN environments. The Advanced Server Con-
figuration Manager utility allows you to select one or more of the fol-
lowing methods for NetBIOS name resolution for WANs:

o  LMHOSTS file

o  Windows Internet Name Service (WINS)

o  DNS

Note: Enabling DNS allows the server and clients to use a specified
DNS name server for NetBIOS name resolution as a last resort if all
other methods fail to resolve a NetBIOS name. DNS is also used by server
clients to resolve the server cluster alias and to provide dynamic load
balancing and failover on servers in an OpenVMS Cluster in a WAN en-
vironment. The DNS name server used for load balancing must support
dynamic updates (Berkeley Internet Name Domain [BIND] server, Version
8.1.1 or later).

DNS is not configured as a replacement for WINS or LMHOSTS but rather
as a supplement. The Advanced Server still uses WINS, LMHOSTS, or broad-
cast methods for resolving names.

Note Advanced Server for OpenVMS supports dynamic purging and reload-
ing of the NetBIOS name cache, and the ability to display the name cache
contents - similar to the NBSTAT capabilities provided on some Microsoft
clients.

Flexible Security Models

The Advanced Server allows you to choose one of two modes of security,
depending on the needs of your environment:

                                 8

 

o  In Advanced Server Only mode, only the Advanced Server (Windows NT
   Server style) security model is enforced.

This mode is sufficient for most network environments. The Advanced
Server employs a user-level security model that provides precise con-
trol over access to shared resources, including disk devices, direc-
tories, and printers. Control is based on a password assigned to each
user account and the specific access permissions defined for the re-
sources.

The Advanced Server incorporates enhanced features that provide a high
level of control over user and resource permissions and auditing. These
features include support of discretionary access control permissions
on individual files, directories, and resources and complete audit-
ing capabilities.

Like Windows NT Servers, Advanced Server does not support share-level
security and operates in user-level security mode only.

o  In the Advanced Server and OpenVMS security mode, both the Open-
   VMS and Advanced Server security models are enforced.

Use of both security models is never necessary to control user access
to resources, but is provided to allow administrators of systems with
complex OpenVMS security controls already in place to use those same
controls to restrict access by client users. Note that use of the Ad-
vanced Server and OpenVMS security model results in the extra over-
head of validating both the Advanced Server and OpenVMS settings.

In addition, the Advanced Server supports external authentication (al-
lowing OpenVMS users to log in at the OpenVMS prompt using their do-
main user name and password) and password synchronization between Open-
VMS and Advanced Server systems, and it supports user account lock-
out.

Domain Support

Advanced Server allows the network to be subdivided into domains (ad-
ministrative groups of servers and clients). Domains are a convenient
mechanism for controlling user access to the network and for manag-
ing large networks. The Advanced Server can be a member of a single

                                 9

 

domain. The Advanced Server can be a primary domain controller (PDC),
a backup domain controller (BDC), or a member server.

The Advanced Server can be deployed as the PDC in a network compris-
ing other Advanced Servers, Windows NT Servers, PATHWORKS for Open-
VMS (LAN Manager) servers, or LAN Manager for OS/2 servers. It also
can act as a BDC for other Advanced Servers and Windows NT Server com-
puters. In addition, the Advanced Server can act as a BDC in Windows
2000 mixed-mode domains, or as a member server in Windows 2000 native-
mode and mixed-mode domains, in accord with the limitations imposed
by Microsoft on Windows NT V4-compatible servers.

The Advanced Server for UNIX can be part of the same domain with Ad-
vanced Server for OpenVMS and can be designated as either the PDC or
the BDC.

Advanced Server for OpenVMS provides support for wide area networks
using one or more of the following methods:

o  LMHOSTS file

The presence of the LMHOSTS file on Advanced Server allows NetLogon
services and security database replication over wide area TCP/IP con-
figurations. This file contains a list of nodes from geographically
dispersed sites synchronized by the PDC and accessible to clients in
the server's domain. However, use of the LMHOSTS file for replication
over extreme distances or in networks with slow transmission speeds
is not recommended.

o  WINS (Windows Internet Name Service)

Support for WINS allows the Advanced Server to act as a WINS client;
that is, to use the name registration and resolution facilities avail-
able from Microsoft WINS services across routed wide area TCP/IP net-
works, thus enabling WAN support for domain functions, NetLogon ser-
vices, and security database replication.

o  DNS


                                10

 

This allows the Advanced Server and clients to use a DNS server for
NetBIOS name resolution. The Advanced Server and clients use DNS for
name resolution as a last resort if all other methods fail to resolve
a NetBIOS name.

Trust Relationships

The Advanced Server supports trusts. Trust relationships can allow users
from other domains to access resources in the local domain, and al-
lows local domain users to access resources in other domains.

NetLogon Services

A single domainwide logon lets a user access resources on any server
in a domain or on servers in other domains that trust the domain.

The domain capabilities of the Advanced Server make it possible for
a user to issue a single logon request to authenticate the user for
access to multiple servers in a network. The NetLogon service forces
the validation of users' logon requests. The logon server that pro-
cesses a request checks its copy of the domainwide user accounts database
for the user name and password supplied in the logon request.

Network Browser Services

The Advanced Server can act as a Master Browser in a Windows NT net-
work.

TimeSource Services

DOS and Windows clients can request date and time information from the
Advanced Server and set the local workstation date and time to coin-
cide with it.

User Environment Management

Logon scripts can be used to configure MS-DOS and Windows workstation
user environments by making network connections and starting appli-
cations. User profiles can make workstations easier to use, as well
as control workstation access to network resources.

                                11

 

Server Management and Control

The Advanced Server can be managed from either the OpenVMS server or
a client workstation, using one of the following server management in-
terfaces:

o  The Advanced Server ADMINISTER command-line interface, which can
   be accessed from a terminal or terminal emulator. It conforms to
   standard DCL command syntax.

o  Windows NT server administration tools, which are included in the
   Advanced Server software kit to be installed on Windows NT, Win-
   dows 95, Windows 98, and Windows for Workgroups workstations. These
   tools, including Server Manager, User Manager for Domains, and Event
   Viewer, allow you to administer Advanced Server and Windows NT Server
   computers from network clients.

o  Windows NT Server tools, which are available as part of the Windows NT
   Server.

o  Windows 2000 file and print server tools, which are available as
   part of the Windows 2000 Server.

Server management interfaces can be used to:

o  Manage file and printer shares, user accounts, and groups

o  Display and control server resources currently in use, such as ac-
   tive sessions, connections, and services

o  View context-sensitive online help that provides command syntax,
   options, and qualifiers for each menu item and command

The Advanced Server can be administered remotely from PATHWORKS and
Microsoft Windows client workstations. The Advanced Server can also
be managed remotely from Windows NT Server, Windows 2000 Server, PATH-
WORKS Advanced Server, and other Advanced Server for OpenVMS systems.

Other Advanced Server tools are provided for management of other as-
pects of the file server. These tools are to be used for local server
management only and include:

                                12

 

o  The Advanced Server Configuration Manager utility (a character cell
   interface) to manage local server configuration parameters that are,
   for the most part, directly or indirectly related to the environ-
   ment in which the server operates, such as the server's usage of
   OpenVMS system resources. Any adjustments that need to be made to
   the OpenVMS SYSGEN parameters to support the running of the server
   are automatically performed by the Configuration Manager utility.

o  The Advanced Server Parameter Management utility (PWRK$REGUTL) to
   manage server configuration parameters that affect the behavior of
   the Advanced Server but not, for the most part, file server resource
   consumption.

o  The License Manager (a character cell interface) to manage the Li-
   cense Server.

Windows 2000 and Windows XP Support

The Advanced Server supports:

o  Windows 2000 and Windows XP Professional clients. For Windows XP
   Professional support, check with Compaq customer support.

o  Windows 2000 domain controllers in a Windows 2000 mixed-mode do-
   main, when the Advanced Server is a backup domain controller or mem-
   ber server; Windows 2000 domain controllers in a pure (native) Win-
   dows 2000 domain, when the Advanced Server is a member server.

Integrating with Microsoft Environments

The Advanced Server for OpenVMS provides numerous Windows NT integra-
tion features, including those provided on OpenVMS Alpha systems. These
features include:

o  Extended File Specifications, based on ODS-5, with support of long
   names and deep directories

o  Unicode characters and extended character sets

o  Alias file names, generated automatically to provide compatibil-
   ity with legacy applications that only support file names that com-
   ply with the more limited MS-DOS name conventions

                                13

 

o  Remote management from:

   -  Network clients, using Windows NT server administration tools
      that are provided for installation on the clients

   -  Windows NT Servers, using tools available on the Windows NT Server

o  Windows NT management of shared printers

o  Windows NT security model

o  PDC, BDC, or member server participation in domains

o  Master Browser or Backup Browser participation in domains

o  Windows NT-compatible Server Message Block (SMB) file and print pro-
   tocols

o  Connections from a wide variety of Windows clients

Integrating with OpenVMS

Advanced Server encompasses many features of the OpenVMS operating sys-
tem, including OpenVMS Clusters and symmetric multiprocessing. Open-
VMS Cluster configurations provide load-balancing failover availabil-
ity and extensive resource capacities by integrating multiple Open-
VMS systems that can be accessed using a single cluster name.

The Advanced Server includes support for a transport-independent clus-
ter alias NetBIOS name that allows multiple cluster members to appear
as a single server to the connecting clients. This provides higher avail-
ability. The cluster alias name has a load-balancing feature that con-
nects clients to the cluster member that is the least loaded at the
time the session is established. The Advanced Server includes a high-
performance, clusterwide distributed data cache that provides scal-
ability in a clustered environment.

The Advanced Server supports the use of ODS-2 disk volumes and ODS-
5 disk volumes, a feature of OpenVMS V7.2 and later, for share and file
access by clients. The new ODS-5 based Enhanced File Specifications
provide support for long names.

                                14

 

The Advanced Server for OpenVMS is installed using the OpenVMS POLY-
CENTER Software Installation utility. The Advanced Server for Open-
VMS uses the OpenVMS Registry to store server parameters.

Integrating with External Authentication

External authentication is an optional feature that allows users to
log in to an OpenVMS system using their Advanced Server (domain se-
curity) user name and password. This feature is useful to OpenVMS sys-
tem managers who want to provide users with a single user name and pass-
word combination for both OpenVMS login and Advanced Server network
logon.

If external authentication is being used in an OpenVMS Cluster, all
cluster members should be configured to process OpenVMS logon requests
for network users. You can set up external authentication support on
nodes that do not run Compaq OpenVMS file servers. In mixed-architecture
OpenVMS Clusters with the Advanced Server for OpenVMS running on the
Alpha members, the VAX members can still use external authentication.
For details about setting up external authentication in OpenVMS Clus-
ters, refer to the Advanced Server for OpenVMS Server Installation and
Configuration Guide.

For more information about external authentication for OpenVMS, re-
fer to the Software Product Description for OpenVMS Alpha and VAX (SPD
25.01.xx).

Integrating with OpenVMS Security

The Advanced Server provides an extension to the Windows NT security
model by supporting OpenVMS security enforcement as an optional en-
hancement.

Integrating with OpenVMS Registry

Advanced Server provides network users with access to the OpenVMS Reg-
istry. Advanced Server also stores its own configuration data in the



                                15

 

OpenVMS Registry. The Advanced Server provides the PWRK$REGUTL util-
ity for managing server configuration parameters in the OpenVMS Reg-
istry. The server parameters in the OpenVMS Registry can also be viewed
and managed from a Windows NT based registry editor.

Alerter Service

The Advanced Server includes an Alerter Service that sends automatic
alert messages to clients and users as specified in the Advanced Server
AlertNames parameter setting in the OpenVMS Registry.

Event Log Service

Event logs provide valuable information about server activities. The
administrator can select from several event types and can select, for
each, whether successful or unsuccessful attempts at specific oper-
ations are to generate event messages. Security event messages are gen-
erated based on the audit policy specified for the Advanced Server and
for files and directories.

Replicator Service

Windows NT Servers provide user data replication across domain con-
trollers using the Replicator service. The Replicator service is not
provided by Advanced Servers. Therefore, automatic replication of user
files and directories on Advanced Servers is not supported.

Installation Utilities

The Advanced Server for OpenVMS is installed on the OpenVMS operat-
ing system using the POLYCENTER Software Installation utility. This
utility is also used to verify that the installation was performed prop-
erly and to remove installations.

The installation procedure allows you to install either the complete
Advanced Server software, the standalone License Server only, the stan-
dalone external authentication images only, or both standalone com-
ponents only.


                                16

 

The Advanced Server for OpenVMS installation procedure gives you the
option of delaying a reboot indefinitely, such as when you need to con-
figure or change more settings before rebooting.

PATHWORKS NetWare Server

The PATHWORKS for OpenVMS (NetWare) server software has been retired.
This product is no longer supported, and licenses to use this prod-
uct are no longer sold.

If you are running the PATHWORKS for OpenVMS (NetWare) server on the
same system with Advanced Server, you must remove the NetWare server
software from the system before you install Advanced Server.

License Management

The Advanced Server offers license management for Client Access li-
censes, which can be used in either client-based or server-based mode.
(For details, see the section SOFTWARE LICENSING.)

The license deliverables for Advanced Server are Product Authoriza-
tion Keys (PAKs) that are then used with the OpenVMS License Manage-
ment Facility (LMF). These PAKs must be loaded into an LMF database,
using standard LMF procedures, on an OpenVMS operating system that is
hosting the Advanced Server or an Advanced Server License Server.

The two types of license management are:

o  Client-based license management. The Advanced Server provides a fa-
   cility called Advanced Server License Server that acts as a proxy
   for client systems that require license keys stored in the LMF database
   on an OpenVMS operating system.

A single copy of the License Server software provides and verifies Client
Access licenses being used in client-based mode.

The Advanced Server License Manager, which must be run on the same node
as the License Server, provides a user interface that allows the ad-
ministrator to monitor client-based license usage, to manage license
groups, to set alert levels, to set logging levels for licensing events,

                                17

 

to enable or disable the License Server, and to revoke assigned li-
censes. The Advanced Server License Manager is also used to preallo-
cate licenses to specific "groups" (including the special predefined
Server-Based group described later).

Each LAN needs only one active Advanced Server License Server. (The
License Server provided with the Advanced Server supports Client Ac-
cess licenses for all supported clients.)

The Advanced Server License Registrar, which must be run on the same
system as the file server, verifies the licenses for clients request-
ing access to the server functions. Clients that can produce a valid
Client Access license are allowed access to the services offered by
the Advanced Server.

o  Server-based license management. The Advanced Server also allows
   client access based on the availability of Client Access licenses
   in the local LMF database being used in server-based mode. If a client
   requesting access to the server fails to produce a valid client-
   based license, the Advanced Server License Registrar software checks
   for the availability of a valid Client Access license being used
   in server-based mode. If one is available, the client is allowed
   access.

Client Access licenses can be put into server-based mode in one of two
ways:

   -  If the Advanced Server License Server was not configured for the
      system where Advanced Server is executing, then all Client Ac-
      cess licenses loaded into the local LMF database on that sys-
      tem will be used in server-based mode.

   -  If the Advanced Server License Server was configured for the sys-
      tem where Advanced Server is executing, then all Client Access
      licenses loaded into the local LMF database will, by default,
      be used in client-based mode.




                                18

 

To allow some or all of these licenses to be used in server-based mode,
use the Advanced Server License Manager to allocate a portion of those
licenses to the special predefined Server-Based group. Licenses avail-
able in the Server-Based group will then be available for use in server-
based mode.

Note: The Advanced Server allows you to simultaneously use Client Ac-
cess licenses in both client-based and server-based mode. However, be-
cause clients using Client Access licenses in client-based mode are
already licensed to use the server software, they never consume ad-
ditional Client Access licenses allocated for use in server-based mode.

LAN Manager and PATHWORKS Compatibility

The Advanced Server maintains compatibility with LAN Manager client
and server software. The Advanced Server also maintains compatibil-
ity with PATHWORKS for OpenVMS (Advanced Server).

A PATHWORKS V5.x for OpenVMS (LAN Manager) server:

o  Can be upgraded to an Advanced Server. (You can upgrade PATHWORKS
   V5 for OpenVMS (LAN Manager) to PATHWORKS V6.1 for OpenVMS (Advanced
   Server), then upgrade PATHWORKS V6.1 for OpenVMS (Advanced Server)
   to Advanced Server V7.3A for OpenVMS.)

o  Can continue running PATHWORKS for OpenVMS (LAN Manager) and act
   as a BDC, member server, or standalone server in a domain where the
   PDC is an Advanced Server or a Windows NT Server computer.

HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS

The following systems, components, and peripherals are supported ex-
cept as noted.

Processors Supported

All Alpha processors supported by OpenVMS Version 7.2-2, 7.3, and 7.3-
1 are also supported by Advanced Server for OpenVMS.


                                19

 

Memory Requirements

The Advanced Server requires a minimum of physical memory for proper
installation, configuration, and execution of the software, depend-
ing on the processor type:

o  On Alpha systems, a minimum of 64 MB

Note: These memory requirements are a minimum requirement only. Mem-
ory requirements can vary widely according to the server CPU, the num-
ber of clients using the server and their activities, and the number
and speed of the server's disks and the other applications running on
the server.

For example, a typical configuration supporting a light workload (word
processing or spreadsheet applications) for 50 PC users requires an
Alpha system with approximately 64 MB of memory. This means that 80%
of the system memory and CPU time is dedicated to the Advanced Server,
even though some work might use less.

OPTIONAL HARDWARE

PostScript Printers

The Advanced Server supports all PostScript printers supported by Open-
VMS. Selected PostScript printers may need the DECprint Supervisor for
OpenVMS (DCPS) software to provide access through the OpenVMS queu-
ing system over TCP/IP or DECnet. Refer to the DCPS Software Product
Description (SPD 44.15.xx) for a complete list of the DIGITAL PostScript
printers and other PostScript printers supported by DCPS.

DIGITAL PostScript printers connected by serial lines or DECservers
and printers attached directly to the Ethernet are supported.

Network Interface Controllers

Advanced Server supports the following Ethernet, FDDI, and Token Ring
network hardware devices:

o  For the TCP/IP transport, Advanced Server supports the network hard-
   ware devices supported by the specific TCP/IP product. Refer to the

                                20

 

   Software Product Description for Compaq TCP/IP Services for Open-
   VMS (SPD 46.46.xx). For information about what software versions
   of Compaq TCP/IP for OpenVMS are supported, see the section SOFT-
   WARE REQUIREMENTS. For information about other TCP/IP products, con-
   tact the vendor.

o  For the DECnet transport using Ethernet, FDDI, or Token Ring, see
   the SPD for the following product:

   -  Compaq DECnet-Plus for OpenVMS Alpha (SPD 50.45.xx)

For information about what software versions of DECnet are supported,
see SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS.

o  For the NetBEUI transport, Advanced Server provides the same level
   of support for Ethernet and FDDI as the OpenVMS Alpha and VAX op-
   erating systems. For more information, see the Software Product De-
   scription for the OpenVMS Alpha and VAX operating system (SPD 25.01.xx).

Note: Advanced Server does not support the DEFZA FDDI controller.

CLUSTER ENVIRONMENT

Advanced Server runs on members of OpenVMS Clusters. OpenVMS Cluster
configurations are fully described in the Software Product Descrip-
tion for OpenVMS Cluster Software (SPD 29.78.xx)

The Advanced Server for OpenVMS can run on members of an OpenVMS Clus-
ter that are running OpenVMS Alpha Version 7.2-2, 7.3, or 7.3-1. Mixed-
version clusters are supported if all cluster members upon which the
Advanced Server for OpenVMS runs are running OpenVMS Versions 7.2-2,
7.3, or 7.3-1. The enhanced OpenVMS Registry components of Versions
7.2-2, 7.3, and 7.3-1 are compatible with each other, but they are in-
compatible with the Registry components of earlier versions of Open-
VMS. Therefore, you cannot run Registry servers or clients (such as
the Advanced Server for OpenVMS) on both the earlier and later Open-
VMS systems at the same time. For more information, refer to the Open-
VMS Alpha release notes for the latest system you are running.


                                21

 

Advanced Server supports up to 31 server nodes in a cluster; no more
than 31 nodes in a cluster can run Advanced Server concurrently. In
a typical scenario, the server runs on only a few central nodes, to
exploit the cluster's shared disks and high-speed interconnect envi-
ronment.

In a cluster, Advanced Server supports simultaneous file access by all
nodes running the server. A central event log, central Advanced Server
accounts, and share databases are maintained in a cluster. In an Ad-
vanced Server domain, the OpenVMS Cluster represents a single domain
member, whether it is acting as the PDC, BDC, or a member server.

SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS

Operating System

o  OpenVMS Alpha Version 7.2-2, 7.3, or 7.3-1

For minimum hardware requirements of the operating system, refer to
the Software Product Description for OpenVMS Alpha and VAX (SPD 25.01.xx).

Network Transport Software

Advanced Server includes NetBEUI network transport software. TCP/IP
or DECnet network transport software might also be required by Advanced
Server, depending on the transport used by clients requiring connec-
tions to the server, or for use of some features.

When the Advanced Server is to be used in a TCP/IP environment, OpenVMS-
based TCP/IP software is required. This software must be purchased sep-
arately. The following TCP/IP transports are compatible with the Ad-
vanced Server:

o  Compaq TCP/IP Services for OpenVMS. The versions supported for each
   version of the OpenVMS operating system are indicated in Table 1,
   Compaq TCP/IP Services for OpenVMS Versions Supported.

o  MultiNet for OpenVMS (from Process Software Corporation)

o  TCPware for OpenVMS (from Process Software)

                                22

 

Note: Third-party TCP/IP products must include a PATHWORKS IP (PWIP)
driver in order to work with the Advanced Server.

PATHWORKS Software

The Advanced Server for OpenVMS cannot run on the same system as other
PATHWORKS server products. Specifically, this includes:

o  PATHWORKS V5.0 for OpenVMS (LAN Manager). You can upgrade the PATH-
   WORKS V5.0 for OpenVMS (LAN Manager) server to PATHWORKS V6.1 for

                                23

 

   OpenVMS (Advanced Server). Running the Advanced Server on a sys-
   tem also running the PATHWORKS V5.0 for OpenVMS (LAN Manager) is
   not possible or supported. You cannot continue to run the PATHWORKS
   for OpenVMS (LAN Manager) software, once the Advanced Server soft-
   ware has been installed. The Advanced Server cannot coexist on the
   same OpenVMS Cluster with the PATHWORKS for OpenVMS (LAN Manager)
   server.

o  PATHWORKS V6.1 for OpenVMS (Advanced Server). You can upgrade the
   PATHWORKS V6.1 for OpenVMS (Advanced Server) to Advanced Server for
   OpenVMS. Running any PATHWORKS for OpenVMS (Advanced Server) server
   on a system that is also running the Advanced Server for OpenVMS
   is not possible or supported. You cannot continue to run the PATH-
   WORKS for OpenVMS (Advanced Server) once the Advanced Server for
   OpenVMS software has been installed. The Advanced Server for Open-
   VMS cannot coexist on the same OpenVMS Cluster with PATHWORKS for
   OpenVMS (Advanced Server).

The Advanced Server maintains down-level compatibility with LAN Man-
ager client and server software. LAN Manager users can add an Advanced
Server to an existing network and migrate to the new technology at their
own pace. A PATHWORKS for OpenVMS (LAN Manager) server can be upgraded
to act as a BDC, member server, or standalone server in a network in
which the PDC is an Advanced Server or a Windows NT Server computer.

The Advanced Server can be deployed as a PDC in a network comprising
other Advanced Server for OpenVMS servers, Windows NT Servers, PATH-
WORKS for OpenVMS (Advanced Server) servers, PATHWORKS for OpenVMS (LAN
Manager) servers, or LAN Manager for OS/2 Servers. It can also act as
a BDC for other Advanced Server for OpenVMS, PATHWORKS Advanced Server,
or Windows NT Server computers.

In addition, the Advanced Server can act as a BDC in Windows 2000 mixed-
mode domains, or as a member server in Windows 2000 native-mode and
mixed-mode domains.

PRODUCT NAME:  Compaq PATHWORKS V6.1 for OpenVMS (Advanced Server)

DESCRIPTION

Compaq PATHWORKS for OpenVMS (Advanced Server), also known as the PATH-
WORKS Advanced Server, is an OpenVMS layered application providing a
network operating system that is compatible with the Microsoft net-
working technology. In particular, PATHWORKS for OpenVMS (Advanced Server)
is based on the Windows NT Server, but it provides additional features.
It enhances the Windows NT Server functionality by incorporating both
OpenVMS and Microsoft technology to deliver powerful features for net-
work administration and enhanced security. It combines the network-
ing strengths and rich application set of Windows NT with the proven
availability, reliability, scalability, and security of OpenVMS. The
Advanced Server can operate independently or in cooperation with the
Windows NT Server.

As a server for workstations on a network, PATHWORKS Advanced Server
provides file and print shares that enable a community of desktop users
to share computing resources efficiently. PATHWORKS Advanced Server
can function as a simple file and print server for a small, isolated
community of users or as the foundation of a large network distributed
over a wide geographical area.

PATHWORKS Advanced Server software lets DOS, Windows, Windows NT, Win-
dows 95, Windows 98, Windows 2000, Windows XP Professional, and Open-
VMS users share printers connected to VAX computers, Alpha computers,
or OpenVMS Cluster systems, as well as network-based printers such as
LAT printers and PrintServers.

PATHWORKS Advanced Server represents LAN Manager systems technology.
It enhances the LAN Manager functionality by incorporating Microsoft
technology to deliver powerful features for network administration and
enhanced security. PATHWORKS Advanced Server can operate independently
or in cooperation with systems running Windows NT Server software.



                                26

 

FEATURES

PATHWORKS Advanced Server adds an additional dimension to general pur-
pose OpenVMS systems. In addition to providing traditional support for
business, scientific, and engineering applications, PATHWORKS Advanced
Server allows an OpenVMS system to appear to PC clients as a Windows NT
Server.

The major features of PATHWORKS Advanced Server are described in the
following sections.

File Services

PATHWORKS Advanced Server provides clients with a remote file system
that appears as a transparent extension of the client system's local
computing environment.

PATHWORKS Advanced Server lets users share OpenVMS files. PATHWORKS
Advanced Server file shares are based on Microsoft's Advanced Server
V3.0 SMB (Server Message Block) protocols. You can use discretionary
access Windows NT controls on each file and directory to specify the
groups and users that can access files, to define the levels of ac-
cess that each group or user is permitted, and to control auditing sup-
ported by Windows NT-like security. Additional, optional security is
provided by OpenVMS file and directory protections.

Each file stored in a file service is stored as an OpenVMS file in Record
Management Services (RMS) format. Three types of RMS file or record
formats are allowed and supported on each volume:

o  Sequential stream

o  Sequential fixed-length record (512 bytes per record)

o  Sequential undefined

Files stored in a file service are accessible to PC clients, to Open-
VMS users, and to applications that can interpret the content and or-
ganization of a file written by the client application.

                                27

 

Multiple clients can concurrently access files stored on the server's
disk through the file-access modes and byte-range locking support pro-
vided by PATHWORKS Advanced Server.

Note: The Advanced Server does not support concurrent simultaneous ac-
cess to files by OpenVMS processes and the Advanced Server processes.
To enable compatibility with legacy applications such as MS-DOS, the
Advanced Server automatically creates
MS-DOS-compatible alias file names for files whose names do not com-
ply with the file naming standards of those applications. As a result,
client applications that must use, or choose to use, the MS-DOS for-
mat for file names, can access these shared files on the server by us-
ing the file's associated alias name.

Print Shares

PATHWORKS Advanced Server software lets DOS, Windows, Windows NT, Win-
dows 95, Windows 98, Windows 2000, Windows XP Professional, and Open-
VMS users share printers connected to VAX computers, Alpha computers,
or OpenVMS Cluster systems, as well as network-based printers such as
LAT printers and PrintServers. Print shares are supported in local area
network (LAN) and wide area network (WAN) environments. PC clients can
print files from the DOS, Windows, Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows 2000,
Windows XP Professional, and Windows NT operating systems as well as
from PC applications.

Multiple print shares can be defined for a single printer. For exam-
ple, separate services can be created for landscape-mode printing and
portrait-mode printing. Similarly, separate services can be created
for DIGITAL mode and IBM ProPrinter mode printing for a single LA75
printer.

PATHWORKS Advanced Server supports the DECprint Supervisor for Open-
VMS (DCPS) product, which provides PostScript and DEC ANSI printing
to selected industry-standard PostScript printers.





                                28

 

Sharing of Network Resources by Heterogeneous Users

Services provided by PATHWORKS Advanced Server are accessible to PATH-
WORKS clients as well as to Microsoft clients. All clients using the
services of a PATHWORKS Advanced Server must be properly licensed. (For
more information, see the section SOFTWARE LICENSING.)

Files are stored on the server in native OpenVMS RMS format. This al-
lows information stored by the PCs using PATHWORKS Advanced Server to
be shared with traditional OpenVMS users. In addition, this feature
allows information to be shared among all clients.

Network Transports

PATHWORKS Advanced Server supports TCP/IP, DECnet (Phase IV), DECnet-
Plus (formerly known as DECnet/OSI), and NetBEUI network transport soft-
ware. One or more transport stacks can work concurrently on the server.

Both the TCP/IP and DECnet network transports are sold as separate Com-
paq products and require separate licenses.

NetBEUI transport software is included with PATHWORKS Advanced Server
software. Using NetBEUI transport software, LAN Manager clients can
access the server in the LAN for file and print shares. NetBEUI is rec-
ommended for use in small LAN-only environments of 50 nodes or less.
For information about supported network transport software, see the
section SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS.

NetBIOS Interface

PATHWORKS Advanced Server supports the NetBIOS interface in TCP/IP,
DECnet, and NetBEUI networks, using multiple transport stacks on a sin-
gle controller or on different network controllers. However, a Net-
BIOS programming interface is not provided.

NetBIOS support under TCP/IP includes both a p-node and a b-node RFC
1001/1002 implementation. Therefore, the NetBIOS interface can be used
under TCP/IP in both LAN and WAN environments. The PATHWORKS Advanced
Server Configuration Manager utility allows you to select one or both
of the following methods for NetBIOS name resolution for WANs:

                                29

 

o  LMHOSTS file

o  Windows Internet Name Service (WINS)

o  DNS

Note: Enabling DNS allows the server and clients to use a specified
DNS name server for NetBIOS name resolution as a last resort if all
other methods fail to resolve a NetBIOS name. DNS is also used by server
clients to resolve the server cluster alias and to provide dynamic load
balancing and failover on servers in an OpenVMS Cluster in a WAN en-
vironment. The DNS name server used for load balancing must support
dynamic updates (Berkeley Internet Name Domain [BIND] server, Version
8.1.1 or later).

DNS is not configured as a replacement for WINS or LMHOSTS but rather
as a supplement. The Advanced Server still uses WINS, LMHOSTS, or broad-
cast methods for resolving names.

Flexible Security Models

The Advanced Server allows you to choose one of two modes of security,
depending on the needs of your environment:

o  In Advanced Server Only mode, only the Advanced Server (Windows NT
   Server style) security model is enforced.

This mode is sufficient for most network environments. The Advanced
Server employs a user-level security model that provides precise con-
trol over access to shared resources, including disk devices, direc-
tories, and printers. Control is based on a password assigned to each
user account and the specific access permissions defined for the re-
sources.

The Advanced Server incorporates enhanced features that provide a high
level of control over user and resource permissions and auditing. These
features include support of discretionary access control permissions
on individual files, directories, and resources and complete audit-
ing capabilities.

Like Windows NT Servers, Advanced Server does not support share-level
security and operates in user-level security mode only.

                                30

 

o  In the Advanced Server and OpenVMS security mode, both the Open-
   VMS and Advanced Server security models are enforced.

Use of both security models is never necessary to control user access
to resources, but is provided to allow administrators of systems with
complex OpenVMS security controls already in place to use those same
controls to restrict access by client users. Note that use of the Ad-
vanced Server and OpenVMS security model results in the extra over-
head of validating both the Advanced Server and OpenVMS settings.

In addition, the Advanced Server supports external authentication (al-
lowing OpenVMS users to log in at the OpenVMS prompt using their do-
main user name and password) and password synchronization between Open-
VMS and Advanced Server systems, and it supports user account lock-
out.

Domain Support

PATHWORKS Advanced Server allows the network to be subdivided into do-
mains (administrative groups of servers and clients). Each PATHWORKS
Advanced Server can be a member of a single domain. A PATHWORKS Ad-
vanced Server can be a primary domain controller (PDC), a backup do-
main controller (BDC), or a member server. Domains are a convenient
mechanism for controlling user access to the network and for manag-
ing large networks.

The Advanced Server can be deployed as the PDC in a network compris-
ing other Advanced Servers, Windows NT Servers, PATHWORKS for Open-
VMS (LAN Manager) servers, or LAN Manager for OS/2 servers. It also
can act as a BDC for other Advanced Servers and Windows NT Server com-
puters. In addition, the Advanced Server can act as a BDC in Windows
2000 mixed-mode domains, or as a member server in Windows 2000 native-
mode and mixed-mode domains, in accord with the limitations imposed
by Microsoft on Windows NT V4-compatible servers.

Advanced Server for UNIX, as well as any Windows NT compatible server,
can be part of the same domain with PATHWORKS for OpenVMS (Advanced
Server) and can be designated as either the PDC or BDC.


                                31

 

PATHWORKS Advanced Server provides support for wide area domains us-
ing one or both of the following methods:

o  LMHOSTS file

The presence of the LMHOSTS file on the PATHWORKS Advanced Server al-
lows NetLogon services and security database replication over wide area
TCP/IP configurations. This file contains a list of nodes from geo-
graphically dispersed sites synchronized by the PDC and accessible to
clients in the server's domain. However, use of the LMHOSTS file for
replication over extreme distances or in networks with slow transmis-
sion speeds is not recommended.

o  WINS (Windows Internet Name Service)

Support for WINS allows PATHWORKS Advanced Server to act as a WINS client;
that is, to use the name registration and resolution facilities avail-
able from Microsoft WINS services across routed wide area TCP/IP net-
works, thus enabling WAN support for domain functions, NetLogon ser-
vices, and security database replication.

o  DNS

This allows the Advanced Server and clients to use a DNS server for
NetBIOS name resolution. The Advanced Server and clients use DNS for
name resolution as a last resort if all other methods fail to resolve
a NetBIOS name.

Trust Relationships

PATHWORKS Advanced Server supports trusts. Trust relationships can al-
low users from other domains to access resources in the local domain,
and allows local domain users to access resources in other domains.

NetLogon Services

A single domainwide logon lets a user access resources on any server
in a domain or on servers in other domains that trust the domain.


                                32

 

The domain capabilities of PATHWORKS Advanced Server make it possi-
ble for a user to issue a single logon request to authenticate the user
for access to multiple servers in a network. The NetLogon service forces
the validation of users' logon requests. The logon server that pro-
cesses a request checks its copy of the domainwide user accounts database
for the user name and password supplied in the logon request.

Network Browser Services

PATHWORKS Advanced Server can act as a Master Browser in a Windows NT
network.

TimeSource Services

DOS, Windows, and clients can request date and time information from
the PATHWORKS Advanced Server and set the local workstation date and
time to coincide with it.

User Environment Management

Logon scripts can be used to configure MS-DOS and Windows workstation
user environments by making network connections and starting appli-
cations. User profiles can make workstations easier to use, as well
as control workstation access to network resources.

Server Management and Control

PATHWORKS Advanced Server can be managed from either the OpenVMS server
or a client workstation, using one of the following server management
interfaces:

o  PATHWORKS Advanced Server ADMINISTER command line interface, which
   can be accessed from a terminal or terminal emulator. It conforms
   to standard DCL command syntax.

o  Windows NT server administration tools, which are included in the
   PATHWORKS Advanced Server software kit to be installed on Windows NT,
   Windows 95, Windows 98, and Windows for Workgroups workstations.
   These tools, including Server Manager, User Manager for Domains,
   and Event Viewer, allow you to administer PATHWORKS Advanced Server
   and Windows NT Server computers from network clients.

                                33

 

o  Windows NT Server tools, which are available as part of the Windows NT
   Server.

Server management interfaces can be used to:

o  Manage file and printer shares, user accounts, and groups.

o  Display and control server resources currently in use, such as ac-
   tive sessions, connections, and services.

o  View context-sensitive online help that provides command syntax,
   options, and qualifiers for each menu item and command.

PATHWORKS Advanced Server can be remotely administered from PATHWORKS
and Microsoft Windows client workstations. PATHWORKS Advanced Server
can also be managed remotely from Windows NT Server, Advanced Server
for OpenVMS, and other PATHWORKS Advanced Server systems.

Other PATHWORKS Advanced Server tools are provided for management of
other aspects of the file server. These tools are to be used for lo-
cal server management only and include:

o  The PATHWORKS Advanced Server Configuration Manager utility (a char-
   acter cell interface) to manage local server configuration param-
   eters that are, for the most part, directly or indirectly related
   to the environment in which the server operates, such as the server's
   usage of OpenVMS system resources. Any adjustments that need to be
   made to the OpenVMS SYSGEN parameters to support the running of the
   server are automatically performed by the Configuration Manager util-
   ity.

o  The PATHWORKS License Manager (a character-cell interface) to man-
   age the PATHWORKS License Server.

Windows 2000 and Windows XP Support

The Advanced Server supports:

o  Windows 2000 and Windows XP Professional clients. For Windows XP
   support, check with Compaq software support.

                                34

 

o  Windows 2000 domain controllers in a Windows 2000 mixed-mode do-
   main, when the Advanced Server is a backup domain controller or mem-
   ber server; Windows 2000 domain controllers in a pure (native) Win-
   dows 2000 domain, when the Advanced Server is a member server.

Integrating with Microsoft Environments

The Advanced Server provides numerous Windows NT integration features,
such as:

o  Remote management from:

   -  Network clients, using Windows NT server administration tools
      that are provided for installation on the clients

   -  Windows NT Servers, using tools available on the Windows NT Server

o  Windows NT security model

o  PDC, BDC, or member server participation in domains

o  Alias file names, generated automatically to provide compatibil-
   ity with legacy applications that only support file names that com-
   ply with the more limited MS-DOS name conventions

o  Master Browser or Backup Browser participation in domains

o  Windows NT-compatible Server Message Block (SMB) file and print pro-
   tocols

o  Connections from a wide variety of Windows clients

Integrating with OpenVMS

PATHWORKS Advanced Server encompasses many features of the OpenVMS op-
erating system, including OpenVMS Clusters and symmetric multiprocess-
ing. OpenVMS Cluster configurations provide failover availability and
extensive resource capacities by integrating multiple OpenVMS systems
that can be accessed using a single cluster name.

                                35

 

PATHWORKS Advanced Server includes support for a transport-independent
PATHWORKS cluster alias NetBIOS name that allows multiple cluster mem-
bers to appear as a single server to the connecting clients. This pro-
vides higher availability. The PATHWORKS cluster alias name has a load-
balancing feature that connects clients to the cluster member that is
the least loaded at the time the session is established. PATHWORKS Ad-
vanced Server includes a high-performance, clusterwide distributed data
cache that provides scalability in a clustered environment.

PATHWORKS Advanced Server can run on both VAX and Alpha members of ho-
mogeneous or mixed architecture OpenVMS Clusters. PATHWORKS Advanced
Server on Alpha systems supports the use of ODS-2 disk volumes and ODS-
5 disk volumes, a feature of OpenVMS Version 7.2 and later, for share
and file access by clients. However, PATHWORKS V6.1 for OpenVMS (Ad-
vanced Server) does not support the features of ODS-5 devices; instead,
it treats the ODS-5 device as an ODS-2 device.

Integrating with External Authentication

External authentication is an optional feature that allows users to
log in to an OpenVMS system using their PATHWORKS Advanced Server user
name and password. This feature is useful to OpenVMS system managers
who want to provide users with a single user name and password com-
bination for both OpenVMS login and PATHWORKS Advanced Server network
logon.

If external authentication is being used in an OpenVMS Cluster, all
cluster members should be configured to process OpenVMS logon requests
for network users. If one or more members do not support external au-
thentication, user logins might result in unpredictable behavior. To
ensure that external authentication works properly on the cluster, each
node in the cluster should be at OpenVMS Alpha V7.2-2 or later or Open-
VMS VAX 7.2 or later.

For more information about external authentication for OpenVMS, re-
fer to the Software Product Description for OpenVMS Alpha and VAX (SPD
25.01.xx).

Integrating with OpenVMS Security

PATHWORKS Advanced Server provides an extension to the Windows NT se-
curity model by supporting OpenVMS security enforcement as an optional
enhancement.

Alerter Service

PATHWORKS Advanced Server includes an Alerter Service that sends au-
tomatic alert messages to clients and users as specified in the LAN-
MAN.INI file.

Event Log Service

Event logs provide valuable information about server activities. The
administrator can select from several event types and can select, for
each, whether successful or unsuccessful attempts at specific oper-
ations are to generate event messages. Security event messages are gen-
erated based on the audit policy specified for the PATHWORKS Advanced
Server and for files and directories.

Replicator Service

Windows NT Servers provide user data replication across domain con-
trollers using the Replicator service. The Replicator service is not
provided on PATHWORKS Advanced Servers. Therefore, automatic repli-
cation of user files and directories on PATHWORKS Advanced Servers is
not supported.

Installation Utilities

PATHWORKS Advanced Server is installed on OpenVMS systems using the
standard VMSINSTAL procedure. An Installation Verification Procedure
(IVP) is also included, which can be used to confirm that the server
software has been installed properly.

The installation procedure allows you to install PATHWORKS Advanced
Server with the integrated License Server or just the standalone Li-
cense Server, the external authentication images (except on OpenVMS
V6.2), or the Upgrade utility.

                                37

 

PATHWORKS NetWare Server

The PATHWORKS for OpenVMS (NetWare) server software has been retired.
This product is no longer supported, and licenses to use this prod-
uct are no longer sold.

If you are running the PATHWORKS for OpenVMS (NetWare) server on the
same system with PATHWORKS Advanced Server, you must remove the Net-
Ware server software from the system before you install PATHWORKS Ad-
vanced Server.

License Management

PATHWORKS Advanced Server offers license management for Client Access
licenses, which can be used in either client-based or server-based mode.
(For details, see the section SOFTWARE LICENSING.)

The license deliverables for PATHWORKS products are Product Authoriza-
tion Keys (PAKs) that are then used with the OpenVMS License Manage-
ment Facility (LMF). These PAKs must be loaded into an LMF database,
using standard LMF procedures, on an OpenVMS system that is hosting
a PATHWORKS Advanced Server or a PATHWORKS License Server.

The two types of license management are:

o  Client-based license management. PATHWORKS Advanced Server provides
   a facility called PATHWORKS License Server that acts as a proxy for
   client systems that require license keys stored in the LMF database
   on an OpenVMS system.

A single copy of the PATHWORKS License Server software provides and
verifies Client Access licenses being used in client-based mode by clients
running LAN Manager protocols.

The PATHWORKS License Manager, which must be run on the same node as
the License Server, provides a user interface that allows the admin-
istrator to monitor client-based license usage, to manage license groups,
to set alert levels, to set logging levels for licensing events, to
enable or disable the License Server, and to revoke assigned licenses.
The PATHWORKS License Manager is also used to preallocate licenses to

                                38

 

specific "groups" (including the special, predefined server-based group
described later).

Each LAN needs only one active PATHWORKS License Server. (The License
Server provided with PATHWORKS Advanced Server supports Client Access
licenses for all supported clients.)

The PATHWORKS License Registrar, which must be run on the same sys-
tem as the file server, verifies the licenses for clients requesting
access to the server functions. Clients that can produce a valid Client
Access license are allowed access to the services offered by the PATH-
WORKS Advanced Server.

o  Server-based license management. PATHWORKS Advanced Server also al-
   lows client access based on the availability of Client Access li-
   censes in the local LMF database being used in server-based mode.
   If a client requesting access to the server fails to produce a valid
   client-based license, the PATHWORKS License Registrar software checks
   for the availability of a valid Client Access license being used
   in server-based mode. If one is available, the client is allowed
   access.

Client Access licenses can be put into server-based mode in one of two
ways:

   -  If the PATHWORKS License Server was not configured for the sys-
      tem where PATHWORKS Advanced Server is executing, then all Client
      Access licenses loaded into the local LMF database on that sys-
      tem will be used in server-based mode.

   -  If the PATHWORKS License Server was configured for the system
      where PATHWORKS Advanced Server is executing, then all Client
      Access licenses loaded into the local LMF database will, by de-
      fault, be used in client-based mode.

To allow some or all of these licenses to be used in server-based mode,
use the PATHWORKS License Manager to allocate a portion of those li-
censes to the special, predefined Server-Based group. Licenses avail-
able in the Server-Based group will then be available for use in server-
based mode.

                                39

 

Note: PATHWORKS Advanced Server allows you to simultaneously use Client
Access licenses in both client-based and server-based mode. However,
because clients using Client Access licenses in client-based mode are
already licensed to use the server software, they never consume ad-
ditional Client Access licenses allocated for use in server-based mode.

Accommodation of Retired Features

The following features of PATHWORKS V5.0 for OpenVMS (LAN Manager) are
not provided in PATHWORKS V6.1 for OpenVMS (Advanced Server):

o  Standalone server role. PATHWORKS Advanced Server can be config-
   ured as a PDC, BDC, or member server.

o  FAT volumes. To continue to provide FAT volume access to clients,
   you must maintain the PATHWORKS for OpenVMS (LAN Manager) server
   on a separate system. Files held within shares on a FAT volume must
   be migrated to PATHWORKS for OpenVMS (LAN Manager) shares before
   you upgrade to PATHWORKS Advanced Server.

o  Backward-compatibility mode. This mode is used to ease the migra-
   tion from PATHWORKS V4.x to PATHWORKS V5.0 for OpenVMS (LAN Man-
   ager) . Make sure all clients making use of this connection for-
   mat are upgraded before the installation of PATHWORKS Advanced Server.

o  Remote Boot service. If clients depend on remote booting, you must
   maintain the PATHWORKS for OpenVMS (LAN Manager) server on a sep-
   arate system. Transfer this function to another server that sup-
   ports Remote Boot service before the upgrade.

o  Share-level security. PATHWORKS Advanced Server manages access to
   all resources through user-level security.

o  LAN Manager and creator security mode. The server can be config-
   ured for PATHWORKS Advanced Server Only security model or for PATH-
   WORKS Advanced Server and OpenVMS security model.

o  PATHWORKS for OpenVMS (LAN Manager) Net command-line interface and
   ADMINISTER/PATHWORKS character-cell interface. These features were
   replaced by the PATHWORKS Advanced Server ADMINISTER command-line
   interface. The ADMINISTER command-line interface provides automatic

                                40

 

   translation of a subset of Net commands that have ADMINISTER com-
   mand equivalents.

LAN Manager Compatibility

PATHWORKS Advanced Server maintains compatibility with LAN Manager client
and server software. A PATHWORKS V5.0 for OpenVMS (LAN Manager) server:

o  Can be upgraded to a PATHWORKS Advanced Server.

o  Can continue running PATHWORKS for OpenVMS (LAN Manager) and act
   as a BDC, member server, or standalone server in a domain where the
   PDC is a PATHWORKS Advanced Server or a Windows NT Server computer.

HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS

The following systems, components, and peripherals are supported ex-
cept as noted.

Processors Supported

All VAX and Alpha processors supported by OpenVMS Alpha Version 6.2,
7.2-2, 7.3, and 7.3-1, and by OpenVMS VAX Version 6.2, 7.2, and 7.3,
are also supported by PATHWORKS V6.1 for OpenVMS (Advanced Server),
except for the following:

GPX II

MicroVAX:   MicroVAX I, MicroVAX II, MicroVAX 2000, MicroVAX 3100
            Model 40 and lower

VAX:        VAX-11/725, VAX-11/730, VAX 11/750, VAX 11/780, VAX
            11/782, VAX 11/785

VAXstation: VAXstation I, VAXstation II, VAXstation 2000, VAXsta-
            tion 4000 VLC, VAXstation 8000




                                41

 

Memory Requirements

PATHWORKS Advanced Server requires a minimum of physical memory for
proper installation, configuration, and execution of the software, de-
pending on the processor type:

o  On Alpha systems, a minimum of 64 MB

o  On VAX systems, a minimum of 64 MB

Note: These memory requirements are a minimum requirement only. Mem-
ory requirements can vary widely according to the server CPU, the num-
ber of clients using the server and their activities, and the number
and speed of the server's disks and the other applications running on
the server.

For example, a typical configuration supporting a light workload (word
processing or spreadsheet applications) for 50 PC users requires an
Alpha system with approximately 64 MB of memory. This means that 80%
of the system memory and CPU time are dedicated to PATHWORKS Advanced
Server, even though some work might use less.

OPTIONAL HARDWARE

PostScript Printers

PATHWORKS Advanced Server supports all PostScript printers supported
by OpenVMS. Selected PostScript printers may optionally need the DECprint
Supervisor for OpenVMS (DCPS) software to provide access through the
OpenVMS queuing system over TCP/IP or DECnet. Refer to the DCPS Soft-
ware Product Description (SPD 44.15.xx) for a complete list of the DIG-
ITAL and other PostScript printers supported by DCPS.

DIGITAL PostScript printers connected by serial lines or DECservers
and printers attached directly to the Ethernet are supported.

Non-PostScript Printers

PATHWORKS Advanced Server also supports the following non-PostScript
printers:

troller.

                                43

 

CLUSTER ENVIRONMENT

PATHWORKS Advanced Server runs on members of OpenVMS Clusters. Open-
VMS Cluster configurations are fully described in the Software Prod-
uct Description for OpenVMS Cluster Software (SPD 29.78.xx).

PATHWORKS Advanced Server supports up to 31 server nodes in a clus-
ter. In other words, no more than 31 nodes in a cluster can run PATH-
WORKS Advanced Server concurrently. In a typical scenario, the server
is run on only a few central nodes, to exploit the cluster's shared
disks and high-speed interconnect environment.

In a cluster, PATHWORKS Advanced Server supports simultaneous file ac-
cess by all nodes running the server. A central event log, central Ad-
vanced Server accounts, and share databases are maintained in a clus-
ter. In a PATHWORKS Advanced Server domain, the OpenVMS Cluster rep-
resents a single domain member, whether it is acting as the PDC, BDC,
or a member server.

SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS

Operating System

o  OpenVMS Alpha Version 6.2, 7.2-2, 7.3, and 7.3-1

o  OpenVMS VAX Version 6.2, 7.2, and 7.3

For minimum hardware requirements of the operating system, refer to
the Software Product Description for OpenVMS Alpha and VAX (SPD 25.01.xx).

Network Transport Software

PATHWORKS Advanced Server includes NetBEUI network transport software.
TCP/IP or DECnet network transport software might also be required by
PATHWORKS Advanced Server, depending on the transport used by clients
requiring connections to the server, or for use of some features.

Other PATHWORKS Server Software

The following PATHWORKS server products cannot run on the same sys-
tem as PATHWORKS V6.1 for OpenVMS (Advanced Server):

o  PATHWORKS V5.0 for OpenVMS (LAN Manager). You can upgrade the PATH-
   WORKS V5.0 for OpenVMS (LAN Manager) server to PATHWORKS V6.1 for
   OpenVMS (Advanced Server). Running the PATHWORKS V6.1 for OpenVMS
   (Advanced Server) server on a system also running the PATHWORKS V5.0
   for OpenVMS (LAN Manager) server is not possible or supported. You
   cannot continue to run the PATHWORKS for OpenVMS (LAN Manager) soft-
   ware, once the PATHWORKS Advanced Server software has been installed.
   PATHWORKS Advanced Server cannot coexist on the same OpenVMS Clus-
   ter with PATHWORKS V5.0 for OpenVMS (LAN Manager).

o  PATHWORKS V6 for OpenVMS (Advanced Server). You can upgrade any of
   the previous PATHWORKS V6 for OpenVMS (Advanced Server) servers (V6.0
   through V6.0D) to PATHWORKS V6.1 for OpenVMS (Advanced Server). Run-
   ning any of these earlier servers on a system that is also running
   the PATHWORKS V6.1 for OpenVMS (Advanced Server) is not possible
   or supported. Once the PATHWORKS V6.1 for OpenVMS (Advanced Server)
   has been installed, you cannot continue to run an earlier version

                                46

 

   of the server. PATHWORKS V6.1 for OpenVMS (Advanced Server) can-
   not coexist on the same OpenVMS Cluster with any of the earlier PATH-
   WORKS V6 for OpenVMS (Advanced Server) servers.

PATHWORKS Advanced Server maintains down-level compatibility with LAN
Manager client and server software. LAN Manager users can add PATH-
WORKS Advanced Server to an existing network and migrate to the new
technology at their own pace. A PATHWORKS for OpenVMS (LAN Manager)
server can be upgraded to PATHWORKS Advanced Server technology or act
as a BDC, member server, or standalone server in a network in which
the PDC is a PATHWORKS Advanced Server or a Windows NT Server computer.
PATHWORKS Advanced Server can be deployed as a PDC in a network com-
prising other PATHWORKS Advanced Servers, Windows NT Servers, PATH-
WORKS for OpenVMS (LAN Manager) servers, or LAN Manager for OS/2 servers.
It can also act as a BDC for other PATHWORKS Advanced Server or Windows NT
Server computers. In addition, the Advanced Server can act as a BDC
in Windows 2000 mixed-mode domains, or as a member server in native-
mode and mixed-mode Windows 2000 domains.

Advanced Server for OpenVMS Software

The Advanced Server for OpenVMS cannot run on the same system as the
PATHWORKS V6.1 for OpenVMS (Advanced Server). The PATHWORKS V6.1 for
OpenVMS (Advanced Server) cannot coexist on the same OpenVMS Cluster
with any of the Advanced Server for OpenVMS products.

Licensing and Ordering Information:  Advanced Server V7.3A for Open-
VMS and PATHWORKS V6.1 for OpenVMS (Advanced Server)

SOFTWARE LICENSING

Both the the Advanced Server V7.3A for OpenVMS and PATHWORKS V6.1 for
OpenVMS (Advanced Server) products are licensed for use in exactly the
same way. Each product is purchased by licensing the clients or ap-
plications that use the services provided by the product. There is no
additional fee.

Though previously purchased licenses continue to be valid for use with
pre-V6.0 servers, only the new Client Access licenses can be purchased
when adding new clients to existing systems.

The license required for clients to use Advanced Server file and print
services is referred to as a Client Access license (PAK Product Name:
PWLMXXXCA07.03). (Note: COM for OpenVMS users do not require a license
to use the Advanced Server. Only clients using the file and print servers
require a license.)

Though there is only one license sold for any client using this Ad-
vanced Server, this license can be used in one of two ways:

o  Client-based mode (also known as per-seat mode)

o  Server-based mode (also known as per-server or concurrent-use mode)

A description of the two different licensing modes follows.

o  Client-based licensing mode

When a license for Advanced Server is used in client-based mode, the
right to use the server is assigned electronically to a particular client
or seat. Once the right is assigned, the client system can access all
systems that are running Advanced Server as well as all systems that
are running any previous version of the file and print server. (Note:
In client-based mode, the PAK associated with the Client Access li-
cense works only with PATHWORKS V5.0 for OpenVMS (LAN Manager) servers

                                49

 

that have been upgraded to a minimum of V5.0F. Earlier revisions of
PATHWORKS V5.0x will not recognize this PAK.)

Client-based licensing is typically used when a customer has more than
one server and in systems where clients normally access more than one
server at the same time. Because only one license per client is re-
quired regardless of how many servers are being accessed, client-based
licensing mode can be more economical than server-based mode. In ad-
dition, because a client with a client-based license cannot be refused
access to a server because of license limits, this mode also guaran-
tees that a particular system will always have access to one or more
servers.

Note: To use this licensing mode, a small licensing agent must be loaded
and enabled on each licensed client. The code for this licensing agent
is distributed with the Advanced Server and is also available on CD-
ROM at a nominal fee.

o  Server-based licensing mode

When a license for Advanced Server is used in server-based licensing
mode, any client can access the server and make as many connections
to file services and print shares as needed. (Note: In server-based
mode, the PAK associated with the Client Access license works only with
PATHWORKS V5.0 for OpenVMS (LAN Manager) servers that have been up-
graded to a minimum of V5.0F. Earlier revisions of PATHWORKS V5.0x will
not recognize or use this PAK.)

Server-based licensing works best in situations where all clients use
or access only one server and there are enough licenses available on
each system for all clients to access their assigned server. (A "sys-
tem" is defined as either a standalone system or a cluster.)

(Note: When using server-based licenses to access file and print ser-
vices in an OpenVMS Cluster environment, clients should connect to the
cluster using the Advanced Server cluster alias, if this option is avail-
able. Clients connecting in this way use one server-based license. Clients
connecting directly to specific cluster members use one server-based
license for each connection to a different cluster member. A client
can map multiple drives and printers from a single server while us-
ing a single server-based license.)

                                50

 

The Advanced Server will allow up to "n" clients to access its ser-
vices concurrently, where "n" is the total number of licenses being
used in server-based licensing mode. The server will not allow the "n+1"
client to access its services until one of the first "n" clients has
disconnected from the server.

Though a server can have only "n" licenses available, any number of
clients can potentially access that server. The restriction is based
only on the total number of clients that can connect to the server at
the same time.

For example, if you have 100 licenses assigned to an Advanced Server
in server-based licensing mode, then any 100 clients can make use of
all services offered by the Advanced Server at one time. However, if
an additional client (the 101st) attempts to connect to the server,
the client will be denied access until one of the connected clients
disconnects from all services.

Customers can choose to operate in either client-based or server-based
mode, or in a combination of both. They can change the licensing mode,
as their situation dictates, without contacting or notifying Compaq.

Note that any portion of multiple licenses delivered in a single PAK
can be used in server-based mode, while the remainder can be used in
client-based mode. Because a PAK can legally be loaded on only one sys-
tem, only the system on which the PAK is loaded can use the licenses
in server-based mode. (Note: PAKs must be loaded into a clusterwide,
available LMF database.)

For complete terms and conditions related to Client Access licenses,
refer to the back of your PAK for these licenses, or consult the Soft-
ware Licensing Web site at:

http://www.compaq.com/products/software/info

ORDERING LICENSES

General Information

Unless otherwise noted, licenses related to each part number are de-
livered in a single PAK. Because each PAK can be loaded on only one
system, it is important to order your licenses in a manner that best
fits your needs.

New or Additional Licenses

For new or additional users of Advanced Server software, use the part
numbers in Table 5, New License Part Numbers, to purchase the number
of Client Access licenses required.
