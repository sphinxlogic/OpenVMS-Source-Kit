          PRODUCT NAME:  Compaq C++ Version 5.6C for OpenVMS VAX
          SPD 37.39.12

          DESCRIPTION

          Compaq C++ for OpenVMS VAX is a native programming language product
          that generates optimized position-independent code without employing
          an intermediate translation to C. Compaq C++ is based on The Annotated
          C++ Reference Manual (ARM), by Ellis and Stroustrup. In addition to
          ARM, Compaq C++ supports CFRONT and MS dialects.

          Compaq C++ includes:

          o  A subset of the ANSI C++ Standard Library, including the string li-
             brary, numeric_limits, auto_ptr, standard exception classes, com-
             plex math library, and the Standard Template Library (STL) updated
             to a subset of the September 1996 ANSI C++ draft. Portions of the
             ANSI C++ Standard Library have been implemented using source li-
             censed from and copyrighted by Rogue Wave Software, Inc.

          o  A Compaq C++ Class Library containing the following packages: iostream,
             complex, generic, objection, stopwatch, string, task, messages, and
             vector.

          o  ANSI/ISO C header files enhanced for use with the Compaq C++ com-
             piler. These headers are currently packaged with Compaq C++. Pack-
             aging of the headers is subject to change as they become available
             in subsequent releases of related products.

          o  Features to facilitate porting to Compaq C++ from other C++ imple-
             mentations. The /STANDARD=CFRONT option relaxes error checking for
             better compatibility with C++ compilers based on the AT&T "cfront"

                                                                December 1999

             translator. The /STANDARD=MS option provides better compatibility
             with Microsoft's Visual C++[TM].

          o  Automatic instantiation of templates

          o  A name demangler that enables other tools (besides the compiler and
             debugger) to present demangled names to the user.

          Compaq C++ Version 5.6C for OpenVMS VAX                SPD 37.39.12


          Redistribution of DECC$CRTL.OLB is required only by those applications
          that need to be linked during or after installation on an end user tar-
          get system. When the library remains on the target system the library
          must reside in a product-specific location on the target system and
          not in SYS$LIBRARY. The contents of this object library cannot be in-
          serted into the STARLET library.

          For OpenVMS VAX Versions 5.5-2 the Compaq C++ VAX kit includes a sep-
          arately packaged saveset that contains additional or modified run-time
          library components needed to execute programs developed with the Com-
          paq C++ compiler and class libraries. Revisions to the run-time com-
          ponents are shipped with the OpenVMS operating system rather than the
          Compaq C++ compiler, and the components in this special Compaq C++ saveset,
          or more recent replacements, are included with OpenVMS VAX Version 6.1
          or later.

          HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS
