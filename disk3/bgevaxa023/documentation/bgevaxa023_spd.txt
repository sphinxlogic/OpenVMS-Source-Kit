 PRODUCT NAME:  BASEstar Graphics Enabler, Version 2.3  SPD 36.65.04

 DESCRIPTION

 BASEstar Graphics Enabler (BGE) is a component of the BASEstar prod-
 uct set which provides the ability to create interactive graphical in-
 terfaces for the BASEstar system and user applications.

 A graphical interface is a window containing visual controls (push-
 buttons, listboxes, etc.) and graphical objects whose appearance may
 change dynamically as a function of data received from BASEstar (graphs,
 dials, gauges, moving icons, etc.).

 BGE delivers the capability of creating simple or complex monitoring
 and interactive applications in the BASEstar environment with little
 or no programming activities. Due to flexibility of the graphical tool,
 BGE covers a wide range of applications in all manufacturing indus-
 tries segments.

 BGE provides the mechanism to create and edit graphical models, al-
 lowing the user to drag and drop previously defined objects from a graphic-
 object library, or to create custom-built graphic objects. Then, us-
 ing a simple script language, the user can specify that graphic at-
 tributes of objects be dynamically controlled by BASEstar real-time
 data and events.

 Thus, BGE provides the capability to create a dynamic graphical rep-
 resentation of the plant floor with production and control informa-
 tion that can be easily displayed and analyzed. These screens and in-
 terfaces can be designed so that they pictorially represent manufac-
 turing data, and are visually easy to understand.

                                                           June 1996

                                                         AE-PUPDE-TE

 

 BGE includes collections of pre-built dynamic graphical objects that
 developers can incorporate in their screens. These include:

 o  Over 40 basic graph types

 o  A wide variety of interaction objects (buttons, sliders, text en-
    try, etc.)

 o  Industry-standard symbol libraries

 In addition, BGE readily supports the creation of custom screen ob-
 jects, either for dynamic data display or user interaction, and the
 subsequent re-use of these objects. Such objects can perform actions,
 evaluate expressions, reference variables, call user-defined functions,
 and input data values.

 INSTALLATION

 BGE offers a single installation procedure from which the installer
 may select which components (Runtime, Development, etc.) to install.

 HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS

 Processors Supported

 Any processor that is capable of running the supported versions of the
 operating system.

 Disk Space Requirements (Block Cluster Size = 1)

 For Digital UNIX Alpha systems:

 Disk space required for use (permanent):

 Runtime       9,900 KB
 Develpment    48,000 KB
 Programming   360 KB
 Demos         12,000 KB

 Note: No files are installed in the Root file system.

                                  2

 

 For OpenVMS VAX and Alpha Systems

 Disk space required for installation:

 Runtime       12,000 blocks
 Development   28,000 blocks
 Programming   6,000 blocks
 Demos         20,000 blocks

 Disk space required for use (permanent):

 Runtime       6,000 blocks
 Develpment    14,000 blocks
 Programming   3,000 blocks
 Demos         10,000 blocks

 These counts refer to the disk space required on the system disk. The
 sizes are approximate; actual sizes may vary depending on the user's
 system environment, configuration, and software options.

 Memory Requirements for DECwindows Support

 The minimum supported memory for this application running in a stan-
 dalone DECwindows environment with both the client and server execut-
 ing on that same system is 8 MB.

 The performance and memory usage of DECwindows applications are par-
 ticularly sensitive to system configuration. Less memory may be re-
 quired on the client system (the system where the software is installed
 and executed) if the server (the component that displays the appli-
 cation) resides on another system. More memory may be required on a
 system with several applications running or where it may be desirable
 to improve the performance of an application.

 CLUSTER ENVIRONMENT

 This layered product is fully supported when installed on any valid
 and licensed VAXcluster* configuration without restrictions. The Hard-
 ware Requirements section of this product's Software Product Descrip-
 tion details any special hardware required by this product.

                                  3

 

 *  Denotes variant fields. For additional information on VAXcluster
    configurations are fully described in the VAXcluster Software Prod-
    uct Description (SPD 29.78.xx) and include CI, Ethernet, and Mixed
    Interconnect configurations.

 SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS

 For VAX Systems:

 o  OpenVMS Operating System V5.5-2, V6.0, V6.1, V6.2

 For Alpha Systems:

 o  OpenVMS Operating System V6.1, V6.2

 o  Digital UNIX Operating System V3.0, V3.1, V3.2

 For Workstations Running DECwindows:

 The prerequisite software is DECwindows Motif V1.2

 This product may run in either of the following ways:

 o  Standalone Execution - Running the X11 display server and the client
    application on the same machine.

 o  Remote Execution - Running the X11 display server and the client
    application on different machines.

 VMS DECwindows is part of the OpenVMS VAX Operating System but must
 be installed separately. Installation of VMS DECwindows gives you the
 option to install any or all of the following three components:

 o  VMS DECwindows Compute Server (Base kit; includes runtime support)

 o  VMS DECwindows Device Support

 o  VMS DECwindows Programming Support


                                  4

 

 For standalone execution, the following DECwindows components must be
 installed on the machine:

 o  VMS DECwindows Compute Server

 o  VMS DECwindows Device Support

 o  VMS DECwindows Programming Support

 For remote execution, the following DECwindows components must be in-
 stalled on the machine:
