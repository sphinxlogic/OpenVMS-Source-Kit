          PRODUCT NAME:  Compaq SNA Server                       SPD 27.01.11
                         for OpenVMS VAX, Version 2.3

          DESCRIPTION

          Compaq SNA Server for OpenVMS VAX is a layered software product that
          allows suitably configured OpenVMS VAX systems to directly partici-
          pate in an IBM Systems Network Architecture (SNA) networking environ-
          ment. After installing the SNA Server software and one or more DEC-
          net SNA access routines, users can perform functions such as access-
          ing IBM application programs or other system resources, act as a 3270
          display station, exchange data files and documents with an IBM host,
          and implement distributed application programs that run between the
          OpenVMS VAX and IBM systems.

          Architecturally, an OpenVMS VAX system running Compaq SNA Server for
          OpenVMS VAX appears to the SNA network as a Physical Unit Type 2 node,
          and is attached to the SNA network through a synchronous communica-
          tions device to an IBM 37xx Communications Controller. The SNA server
          software supports one synchronous communications line at speeds of 9.6
          Kbps to 64 Kbps, depending on the communications device being used.
          The SNA server software supports a maximum of 16 to 64 concurrent SNA
          logical unit sessions depending on the VAX CPU and memory on which it
          is running. Both local and remote DECnet connections are supported from
          the Compaq SNA server into the IBM SNA network, using switched or leased
          lines in point-to-point or multipoint environments.

          Compaq SNA Server for OpenVMS VAX also supports connections over X.25
          switched virtual circuits using Qualified Logical Link Control (QLLC).
          An X.25 license is required for SNA over X.25 connections. Refer to
          the Software Requirements section of this Software Product Descrip-
          tion.

                                                                   April 2001

 



          Compaq SNA Server                                     SPD 27.01.11
          for OpenVMS VAX, Version 2.3

          Compaq SNA Server for OpenVMS VAX can send Record Formatted Mainte-
          nance Statistics (RECFMS) messages to the IBM system. These messages
          contain counters requested by the IBM Netview Hardware Monitor using
          Request Maintenance Statistics (REQMS) messages. Not all RECFMS mes-
          sages are supported by Compaq SNA Server for OpenVMS VAX. Refer to the
          SNA Server documentation for more information.

          The functions provided by the SNA server software are comparable to
          those provided by the DECnet SNA Gateway product. Users on one or more
          Compaq systems with SNA access routines can simultaneously perform func-
          tions such as accessing IBM application programs or other system re-
          sources, act as a 3270 display station, perform data transfer between
          Compaq and IBM file systems, exchange electronic documents and mail
          messages, submit jobs to IBM batch subsystems acting as a Remote Job
          Entry workstation, and implement distributed, task-to-task applica-
          tion programs that run between Compaq and IBM systems.

          Systems wishing access to the SNA environment must be configured with
          the appropriate SNA access routines. For additional information about
          which access routines are supported, see the Optional Software sec-
          tion of this Software Product Description.

          A variety of communications devices are supported. Please refer to the
          DECnet-Plus for OpenVMS VAX Software Product Description (SPD 25.03.xx)
          for information about the devices supported by the Compaq SNA Server
          for OpenVMS. Each device supports different configurations. See Ta-
          ble 1 in the Minimum Recommended Configuration section of this prod-
          uct's Software Product Description for details.

          For connection via Synchronous Data Link Control (SDLC) circuits can
          be set full duplex. Data can be sent and received simultaneously on
          full-duplex lines. This setting corresponds to DATMODE=FULL in the IBM
          ACF/NCP PU macro.

          Compaq SNA Server for OpenVMS VAX supports connections over X.25 switched
          virtual circuits (QLLC) as well as SDLC circuits. The QLLC circuit can

          Compaq SNA Server                                     SPD 27.01.11
          for OpenVMS VAX, Version 2.3

          be configured to use either incoming or outgoing X.25 switched vir-
          tual circuits (SVCs). Compaq SNA Server for OpenVMS VAX does not sup-
          port X.25 permanent virtual circuits (PVCs). Compaq SNA Server for Open-
          VMS VAX requires the IBM Network Packet Switched Interface (NPSI) in
          order to use QLLC circuits. The IBM NPSI software should be generated
          to support "Boundary Network Node, Qualified Logical Link control" (BNN
          QLLC) type-3 switched virtual circuits.

          Compaq SNA Server for OpenVMS VAX also supports the following optional
          facilities for QLLC circuits:

          o  Flow Control Negotiation

          o  Closed User Groups

          o  Reverse Charging

          Management Utilities

          The Compaq SNA Server for OpenVMS VAX provides the management util-
          ities SNANCP and SNAEVL. SNANCP is used to manage and monitor SNA server
          components such as line, circuit, physical unit (PU), and logical unit
          (LU). SNANCP provides the human interface for the Compaq system man-
          ager to monitor, control, and troubleshoot the SNA server and its IBM
          SNA environment. All management functions pertaining to SNA server soft-
          ware are performed on VAX system. The SNANCP commands allow users to
          display and modify information pertaining to the line, circuit, PU,
          LUs, and access names. Online help is provided. SNAEVL is used to log
          events generated by these components.

          Management of the Compaq SNA Server node should be viewed as part of
          the Compaq environment; the management of the line connecting the Open-
          VMS VAX system to the IBM system is a joint responsibility of the IBM
          and Compaq system managers.

          Problem Isolation and Determination Tools

          The Common Trace Facility (CTF) is the problem-determination tool that
          provides frame-level tracing of a circuit to help in debugging appli-
          cation programs and identifying system problems. A privileged DECnet-
          Plus user can run a trace at the PU level, SDLC level, or session level.

          for OpenVMS VAX, Version 2.3

          The trace feature is helpful for identifying an error for remedial ac-
          tion.

          The Installation Verification Procedure (IVP) for the Compaq SNA Server
          for OpenVMS VAX, SNAVMS$IVP, is also useful for problem isolation. SNAVMS$IVP
          is run separately from any access routine, and can be used to verify
          connectivity to specific IBM applications over specific LU sessions.
          In failure cases, SNAVMS$IVP displays an expanded error text that at-
          tempts to diagnose the cause of the failure.

          INSTALLATION

          Installation services from Compaq are recommended for a customer's first
          purchase of this software product. These services provide for instal-
          lation of the software by an experienced software specialist.

          HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS

          Processors Supported

          The Compaq SNA Server for OpenVMS VAX  supports the following proces-
          sors and session maximums for local user connections, and an additional
          128 sessions for DECnet connections. Restrictions are based on pro-
          cessor memory, line speeds, and CPU. For information about supported
