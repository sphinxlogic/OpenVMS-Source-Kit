PRODUCT NAME:   hp Reliable Transaction Router Version 4.2 for 51.04.11
                  OpenVMS

DESCRIPTION

HP Reliable Transaction Router (RTR) is fault tolerant transactional
messaging middleware used to implement large, distributed applications
using client/server technology. This version of Reliable Transaction
Router enables enterprises to deploy distributed applications on  Open-
VMS Alpha and VAX systems.

Reliable Transaction Router enables distributed applications to run
in heterogeneous environments, allowing client and server applications
to interoperate on the supported Windows[R], Tru64 UNIX[R], Sun So-
laris, and OpenVMS platforms.

Reliable Transaction Router provides APIs for development of distributed
applications using languages such as C and C++, with optional all-or-
nothing transaction semantics as well as a message broadcasting ca-
pability. C API calls are also available from a command line inter-
face. The C++ API provides an object-oriented interface for develop-
ing user and system management applications. [1] Applications can also
use the X/Open XA interface.

Reliable Transaction Router provides a reliable, transparent, dynamic
message-routing system that includes both a transactional and non-transactional
message control system. RTR transaction management supports two-phase
commit of distributed transactions.

 The  C++ API is not available for the OpenVMS VAX operating system.

Reliable Transaction Router implements automatic software fault tol-
erance and failure recovery in multinode environments by adapting to
many kinds of hardware (CPU), communications, application software,
and site failures. Automatic failover and recovery of service oper-
ate by exploiting redundant or alternate hardware and network links.
If alternate hardware or network links are not available, RTR auto-
matically continues service when the CPU or network link becomes avail-
able.

Reliable Transaction Router applications are developed and deployed
using a three-tier client/router/server software model. Client appli-
cations call the RTR client software tier, which passes messages to
the router tier of the software. Transaction messages are routed re-
liably and transparently, based on message content, to the appropri-
ate processes in the server tier. Server applications typically ex-
ecute transactions against a database and return results back to clients.

A single physical node may run one, two, or three tiers of the RTR client/router/server
software model. Each of the three software tiers may consist of one
or more nodes. The software model and its content-based routing present
a virtual rather than physical network to the application developer.
This model enables application software to be independent of physi-
cal hardware (CPU) location, network naming conventions, and commu-
nications protocol. This facilitates single-node development, and trans-
parent scalability of applications in complex network configurations.

Reliable Transaction Router software fault tolerant features such as
router failover and shadow-server processing provide continuous com-
puting services with completion of in-progress transactions despite
single or multiple points of failure in the distributed client/server
environment. Callout servers implement user authentication control,
and concurrent servers provide dynamic message load balancing for high
performance. High performance transactional messaging is implemented
as a full-duplex conversation with remote server procedures using real-
time flow control techniques. Use of these features generally requires
no special user application programming logic.

The RTR system management interface is available as a command line in-
terface and a web-based interface. The web-based interface provides
a point and click style of managing RTR from a browser.

The browser interface provides monitoring and management of the RTR
configuration with the RTR Manager. Both interfaces allow the creation,
deletion, and modification of application networks (facilities) within
a network, and permit control of distributed RTR processes from a sin-
gle system in the distributed environment. The RTR system management
interfaces are used to bind the physical hardware (CPU and communi-
cations) to a virtual network namespace and are transparent to the ap-
plications software. A monitoring utility can be invoked to report ap-
plication performance information on a local or remote node.

Reliable Transaction Router is independent of forms and window man-
agement systems and databases. Multiple databases and other resource
managers (for example, flat-file systems) can be updated within the
same distributed transaction.

Reliable Transaction Router is intended for distributed applications
that require continuous computing services and transaction integrity
(for example, trading systems, banking systems, electronic commerce,
payment systems, transportation systems, and telecommunications sys-
tems). Reliable Transaction Router can also be used for applications
that require reliable messaging and fault tolerant application con-
trol over LANs or WANs. Reliable Transaction Router provides the en-
abling technology for applications requiring fully distributed client/server
models.

Reliable Transaction Router on OpenVMS provides an interface for con-
trolling transaction commitment directly with a DECdtm compliant re-
source manager.

Backend Features

o  Provides transparent, content-based transaction routing for client/server
   applications.



                                 3

 

o  Provides publish/subscribe broadcast (nontransactional) messaging
   for delivery to multiple subscription domains within a virtual net-
   work.

o  Allows user-defined partitioned data models (content-based rout-
   ing) for improved performance of user applications.

o  Acts as a layer between client and server applications, thus de-
   coupling the end-to-end relationship normally required by user ap-
   plication control. This provides the application developer with a
   single system view of the programming environment.

o  Ensures atomicity of transactions (all or nothing) by using a two-
   phase commit protocol for transactional message delivery among one
   or more server applications.

o  Offers at-most-once semantics for valid transactions. This includes
   specially flagged transaction replay to a surviving server appli-
   cation, or a later instantiation of that server on the same or a
   different machine on the virtual network.

o  DECdtm support is provided for use with resource managers that sup-
   port DECdtm.

o  Supports multiple (concurrent) servers.

o  Supports user authentication control (callout servers) with con-
   sistent reply in shadow environments.

o  Provides disaster protection against site failure by mirroring trans-
   actions in shadow-server environments. Automatic resynchronization
   of shadow pairs after recovery is provided transparently to the ap-
   plication.

o  Maintains performance scaling over a wide range of configurations
   allowing easy horizontal expansion of both hardware systems and ap-
   plication software.

o  Enables automatic failover/failback of server applications on mul-
   tiple backend systems while remaining transparent to client appli-
   cations executing on remote systems. RTR can maintain application
   operation in many instances of single or multiple failures in a widely
   distributed software/hardware configuration.

                                 4

 

o  Includes system management interfaces for online control of vir-
   tual networks from any workstation or terminal with the appropri-
   ate privileges. Monitoring of statistics, software and hardware states,
   and clients and servers is provided from local and remote nodes.

o  Uses HP TCP/IP as the underlying network transport. HP DECnet and
   HP DECnet-Plus are also supported.

o  Enables the operator to manage partitions, providing the ability
   to:

   -  Create or delete a partition with a user-specified name.

   -  Define a key range definition.

   -  Select a preferred primary node.

   -  Select the failover precedence option to choose between local
      and cross-site shadow failover.

   -  Suspend and resume operations to synchronize database backups
      with transaction flows.

   -  Override RTR's automatic recovery decisions to allow manual spe-
      cial recovery procedures.

   -  Specify retry limits for problem transactions.

o  Enables the operator to selectively inspect, modify the state of,
   or remove transactions from the journal or the running RTR system.

o  Supports anonymous clients, that is, allows clients to be config-
   ured with wildcarded node names.

o  Supports compression and decompression of broadcast event and trans-
   action reply data to improve network throughput.

o  Supports failover between multiple IP addresses for any host ma-
   chine with multiple network adapters.

Frontend Features

o  Provides the ability for the client to start transaction branches,
   where the global transaction may be controlled by RTR or another
   external transaction manager.

                                 5

 

o  Provides the necessary environment to run Reliable Transaction Router
   client applications under OpenVMS as part of a Reliable Transac-
   tion Router application network.

o  Provides client functionality in a production environment, as well
   as a single-node application development and testing environment
   for RTR applications.

o  Uses TCP/IP as the underlying network transport. DECnet and HP DECnet-
   Plus are also supported.

o  Supports transactional and broadcast (nontransactional) messages.

o  Supports router load balancing in a facility.

o  Supports automatic failover to another router in the event of a com-
   munication link failure.

o  Supports Reliable Transaction Router system management operations.
