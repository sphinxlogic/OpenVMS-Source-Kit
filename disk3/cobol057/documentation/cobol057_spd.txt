PRODUCT NAME:  Compaq COBOL Version 5.7A for OpenVMS VAX        SPD
25.04.33

DESCRIPTION

Compaq COBOL for OpenVMS VAX, formerly known as VAX COBOL and DIGI-
TAL VAX COBOL, is a high-level language for business data processing
that operates on the OpenVMS VAX Operating System, taking full advan-
tage of the system facilities. Compaq COBOL is based upon the 1985 ANSI
COBOL Standard X3.23-1985 as modified by the X.23a-1989 amendment.

Compaq COBOL adheres to the high level by the National Bureau of Stan-
dards for conformance to FIPS PUB 21-3, Federal Standard COBOL.

The Compaq COBOL Data Manipulation Language (DML), which is based upon
the report of the CODASYL Data Description Language Committee (1978),
allows users to write programs that access databases using the Oracle
DBMS database management system. Oracle DBMS must be installed to use
this feature.

Compaq COBOL includes various extensions to COBOL, including screen
handling at the source language level, file sharing, and record lock-
ing.

Compaq COBOL Version 5.7A for OpenVMS VAX is a documentation update
release. The software product remains unchanged since the Compaq COBOL
V5.7 release. The documentation set has been unified for Compaq COBOL
on VAX and Alpha Systems. For recent release specific technical in-
formation, such as feature enhancements, bug fixes, restrictions and
compatibility charts, please refer to the Compaq COBOL V5.7 Release
Notes.

The following list of extensions to COBOL are implemented in Compaq
COBOL for OpenVMS VAX:

o  Screen handling is implemented using the DISPLAY and ACCEPT state-
   ments. The DISPLAY statement enables the programmer to display in-
   formation or prompts anywhere on a video screen. The ACCEPT state-
   ment takes information typed anywhere on the screen and returns the
   value to a running Compaq COBOL program. The DISPLAY statement con-
   verts data from internal numeric format to ASCII display format,
   and the ACCEPT WITH CONVERSION statement converts ASCII display in-
   put characters to internal numeric formats as appropriate. The terminal-
   type is recognized at run time from information provided by the op-
   erating system.

o  Many file capabilities are available through RMS including exten-
   sions for segmented keys, descending keys, and duplicate primary
   keys.

o  RMS-STS and RMS-STV and RMS-FILENAME special registers may be ex-
   amined to assist debugging. These registers contain status values
   from the Record Management System (RMS) for OpenVMS.

o  File sharing and record locking features enable more than one user
   to access data at the same time.

o  Conditional compilation serves to make debugging easier.

o  The /INSTRUCTION_SET qualifier customizes object code generation
   to target the different classes of VAX processors, maximizing spe-
   cific processor features.

o  The COPY FROM DICTIONARY statement allows access to common record
   definitions stored in the Oracle CDD/Repository. Oracle CDD/Repository
   must be installed to use this feature.

o  Terminal format recognition for program source files.

o  Four-digit year-date support in ACCEPT format 2.

o  Automatic compile-time access to SYS$CURRENCY system logical when
   CURRENCY SIGN clause not specified in user program.

                                 2

 

Compaq COBOL for OpenVMS VAX implements several statements and exten-
sions designed to make programming easier in the OpenVMS for VAX en-
vironment:

o  CALL statement extensions: BY VALUE, BY DESCRIPTOR, OMITTED, and
   GIVING

o  VALUE IS EXTERNAL - Access to link time constants

o  USAGE IS POINTER - Address data type

o  VALUE IS REFERENCE - Compile time address evaluation

o  SET TO REFERENCE - Run time address evaluation

o  SUCCESS/FAILURE - Class conditions

o  Thirty-one-character user-names

o  ACCEPT AT END statement

o  Single-quote-delimited, non-numeric literals

o  Hyphen/underscore equivalence in user-names

o  Non-numeric literal argument passing

The Compaq COBOL compiler produces an object module from a source pro-
gram. The compiler is capable of producing a source listing with em-
bedded diagnostics including the line and column position in source-
code, a machine language listing, a file-name map, a data-name map,
a procedure-name map, an external program name map, database subschema
information, and a cross-reference listing. The cross-reference list-
ing and maps may be produced in either alphabetical order, or in or-
der of declaration. The cross-reference listing distinguishes updat-
ing references to data from read-only references.

Compaq COBOL for OpenVMS VAX provides support for error diagnostics
and cross-reference information to Language-Sensitive Editor/Source
Code Analyzer. Additionally, Compaq COBOL for OpenVMS VAX provides sup-
port for the processing of pseudocode and design comments that are used
by the Compaq Language-Sensitive Editor/Source Code Analyzer for low-
level program design.

Object modules produced by the compiler can be linked with other ob-
ject modules produced by many other OpenVMS VAX languages, including
Compaq's BASIC and Fortran. Compaq COBOL for OpenVMS VAX is supported
by both the OpenVMS VAX Common Run Time Library (RTL) and the Symbolic
Debugger for OpenVMS VAX.

The Compaq COBOL for OpenVMS VAX product includes a COBOL compiler and
the REFORMAT utility. The REFORMAT utility converts source programs
from DIGITAL terminal format to ANSI-standard COBOL format and vice
versa.

HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS

Any VAX system that is capable of running OpenVMS VAX V6.2 or higher.

Disk Space Requirements (Block Cluster Size = 1)

Disk space required          12,000 blocks
during installation:
                             (6.3 Mbytes)

Disk space required for      4,000 blocks
use (permanent):
                             (2.0 Mbytes)

These counts refer to the disk space required on the system disk. The
sizes are approximate; actual sizes may vary depending on the user's
system environment, configuration, and software options.

OPTIONAL HARDWARE

A VT100 family, VT200 family, VT300 family, or VT400 family terminal
is required for the screen handling extensions to the ACCEPT and DIS-
PLAY statements.
