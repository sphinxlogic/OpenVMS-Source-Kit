PRODUCT NAME:   BASEstar Open Client                   SPD 62.54.07
                Version 3.2

DESCRIPTION

BASEstar Open is an industrial automation integration framework that
facilitates the integration of manufacturing applications and plant
equipment. Accelerated development of integrated manufacturing sys-
tems is assured through an architecture that also encourages consis-
tency of application development.

BASEstar Open takes advantage of the client/server computing archi-
tecture. BASEstar Open Servers provide the robust, high-availability
environment required by mission-critical applications. BASEstar Open
Clients, on the other hand, provide access to all BASEstar Open ser-
vices and BASEstar Open-managed information from any network Node on
which BASEstar Open Client is installed. Client and server communi-
cations within BASEstar Open are provided through TCP/IP network com-
munications.

For a description of the BASEstar Open Server product, refer to SPD
47.87.xx.

The BASEstar Open Client allows applications to have transparent ac-
cess to BASEstar Open objects regardless of their physical location
in the distributed BASEstar Open environment. BASEstar Open Client pro-
vides an Application Programming Interface that allows applications
to:

o  Define, reference, and access Data_Point objects

o  Define, reference, notify, subscribe, and receive event objects

o  Define, reference, and exchange Packet data objects.

Features

                              COMPAQ                   February 2000

The following features are those that a BASEstar Open Client can re-
quest from a BASEstar Open Server via BASEstar Open's API:

Application Integration

o  Data Management

BASEstar Open Data Services provide a standard mechanism for defin-
ing, organizing, and accessing data in a distributed manufacturing en-
vironment from a variety of sources including plant devices and area,
plant, and work cell applications.

BASEstar Open defines discrete elements (Data_Points) to contain man-
ufacturing information. Data_Point definitions can be of various types,
ranging from scalar data elements to user-defined data structures. This
provides the high flexibility of data definition and acquisition re-
quired to define the many different types of data typically present
in industrial plants.

Since each Data_Point is referenced by name, applications become in-
dependent of their data sources and consequently do not require al-
teration as data sources change. In addition, simple Data_Points can
have a predefined value specified at startup time. The value of a Data_
Point may also be derived from the value of another Data_Point. The
derived value can be obtained directly or modified by an arithmetic/logical
expression. Data Services allow applications to define and manage Data_
Points.

You can associate each Data_Point with one or more Triggers. A Trig-
ger defines a relationship between a Data_Point, a Filter, and an Event.
Each time the value of a triggered Data_Point changes, associated Fil-
ter expressions are evaluated. Whenever the Boolean result of an eval-
uated Filter expression is TRUE, BASEstar Open declares the associ-
ated Event.

Likewise, the Timer object allows you to apply a time-based condition
to the execution of an action. You can define the time condition as
an absolute date, a time interval, or a combination of the two. When
the Timer expires, BASEstar Open sends a message to the associated ob-
jects. You can associate Timers with Trigger objects.

                                 2

 

It is possible to store one or more versions of a Data_Point value.
In addition to the value, each Data_Point version includes the time
when the Data_Point value changed and its status at that time.

BASEstar Open generates a new version each time the value of a Data_
Point changes. You can therefore request the current version, contain-
ing the current value, or alternatively, the value associated with any
cached version.

o  Event Services

BASEstar Open Event Services allow you to subscribe to one or more Events.
Events are occurrences that are of interest to an application program-
like threshold exceeding, alarms, job completion, and so on. You can
define the occurrence of such Events and specify the context infor-
mation that you wish to pass. This context information can also in-
clude data and their types.

On declaration of an Event, Event Services create and deliver the no-
tifications that the subscribers receive.

o  Packet Services

BASEstar Open Packet Services allow you to exchange Packets of infor-
mation directly with other users. Two users can establish direct com-
munication through a Port; one user connects to send a Packet, and the
other user connects to receive it.

A Packet contains a description of information to be exchanged. Each
Packet input and output parameter is described by a datatype.

BASEstar Open delivers a Packet to a Port in a protocol-independent
manner and also independent of the location of the users and Ports in-
volved.

o  Graphic Configuration Utility (GCU)

BASEstar Open offers a PC-based Graphic Configuration with a Windows
"look and feel". It allows users to:

   o  Manage BASEstar Open objects using create, delete and modify com-
      mands

   o  Load existing configurations from CLI scripts and snapshots

                                 3

 

   o  Save configurations in CLI scripts and snapshots

   o  Browse through BASEstar Open configurations.

The Graphic Configuration is bundled with BASEstar Open Server kits
on Windows NT systems. It is included with the BASEstar Open Client
on Windows NT and Windows 95/98 systems.

BASEstar Open users on Tru64 UNIX or OpenVMS platforms can take ad-
vantage of the Graphic Configuration via the PC-based BASEstar Open
Client and GCU product. The PC-based Graphic Configuration replaces
the Motif-based GCU previously available with BASEstar Open Version
2.0.

o  DDE Connectivity DDE (Dynamic Data Exchange) is a protocol that al-
   lows PC-based applications to exchange data. It ensures compati-
   bility between the PC-based data representation (used on Windows
   NT and Windows 95/98 platforms) and the native BASEstar Open data
   representation. This capability augments significantly the scope
   of BASEstar Open, allowing you to integrate DDE-compliant software
   packages such as Microsoft Excel, InTouch from Wonderware, and DDE
   drivers.

Documentation

BASEstar Open Client is supported by the following documentation:

o  An installation and management guide specific to each operating sys-
   tem, for installing BASEstar Open Client on the selected operat-
   ing system. It provides also instructions on how to manage BASEs-
   tar Open Client components.

o  BASEstar Open Client Release Notes describes new features provided
   with BASEstar Open Client, and details any functional and documen-
   tation errors. This document,too, is specific to each operating sys-
   tem.

SOFTWARE LICENSING

BASEstar Open Client Version 3.2 does not require a local license on
the node where it is installed.

Every BASEstar Open Client node connected a BASEstar Open Server con-
federation (a set of BASEstar Open Server nodes working together) con-
sumes one BASEstar Open client-connection slot while it is working with
the server nodes (this is independent on how many client applications

                                 9

 

are running in the client node and on the accessed realms). The client-
connection slot is freed when no more applications from the client node
are connected to the BASEstar Open confederation. A BASEstar Open con-
federation provides as many client-connection slots as the total num-
ber of client-connection licenses loaded there (more precisely: loaded
in the node where the primary BASEstar Open LNS server was started).
Client-connection licenses can be bought individually or by groups.
