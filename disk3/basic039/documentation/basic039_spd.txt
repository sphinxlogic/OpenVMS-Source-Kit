PRODUCT NAME:  Compaq BASIC Version 1.4 for OpenVMS Alpha SPD   SPD
25.36.32               Compaq BASIC Version 3.9 for OpenVMS VAX

This Software Product Description describes the following two prod-
ucts:

o  Compaq BASIC Version 1.4 for OpenVMS Alpha Systems (formerly DEC
   BASIC)

o  Compaq BASIC Version 3.9 for OpenVMS VAX Systems (formerly VAX BASIC)

The short forms "Alpha BASIC" and "VAX BASIC" are frequently used to
refer to these two product names.

DESCRIPTION

Compaq BASIC is a shareable language processor for the OpenVMS oper-
ating system. It can be invoked as a compiler and the resulting mod-
ules can be linked and run with standard OpenVMS commands. Compaq BA-
SIC provides high performance for application development by gener-
ating inline native mode instructions. Compaq BASIC is also integrated
with various programming productivity tools such as the OpenVMS De-
bugger, the Language-Sensitive Editor (LSE), the Source Code Analyzer
(SCA) and the Performance and Coverage Analyzer.

Alpha BASIC includes three IEEE floating point data types (SFLOAT, TFLOAT,
and XFLOAT) and a QUAD integer data type.
