          PRODUCT NAME:  Compaq
          SNA 3270 Application Services, \SPD 38.70.07 \Version 1.3)

          DESCRIPTION

          The Compaq SNA 3270 Application Services layered software product is
          a member of the Compaq SNA Programming Access Routines family of prod-
          ucts. This family of layered software products consists of a variety
          of programming access routines that enable communications between IBM[R]
          and Compaq applications.

          The Compaq SNA 3270 Application Services software provides a library
          of callable routines and other components for building OpenVMS and Tru64
          UNX applications that support processing of IBM 3270 data streams. When
          used with the Compaq SNA Domain Gateway or Compaq SNA Peer Server, these
          3270 data stream applications can be accessed by SNA networked 3270
          block mode terminal and PC users. Refer to the Compaq SNA Domain Gate-
          way Software Product Description (SPD 38.69.xx) or the Compaq SNA Peer
          Server SPD (51.08.xx) for more information.

          The Compaq SNA 3270 Application Services software provides the fol-
          lowing components:

          o  An application programming interface (API) for developing 3270 data
             stream applications

          o  An OpenVMS print symbiont for printing ASCII files on SNA-attached
             LU Type 1 or Type 3 printers and non-SNA-attached LU Type 0 print-
             ers (OpenVMS only)

          o  DECforms[TM] (Version 1.4) support for building forms-oriented ap-
             plications for 3270 terminals (OpenVMS only)

          o  A mechanism for testing applications without an SNA network

                                                                   April 2001

          Application Programming Interface

          The 3270 Application Services API provides a library of routines for
          developing 3270 data stream applications. These applications can be
          SNA LU Type 1, 2, or 3 applications or non-SNA LU Type 0 applications.
          They can serve as the primary logical unit (PLU) and activate a ses-
          sion with the remote 3270 device as the secondary logical unit (SLU)
          in the SNA network.

          The API is callable from any OpenVMS language conforming to the Open-
          VMS calling standard on OpenVMS systems, and from the C language on
          Tru64 UNIX systems.

          The application that calls the Compaq SNA 3270 Application Services
          API is responsible for generating and interpreting all 3270 data streams.
          The API provides the following features:

          o  Receives incoming LU Type 0, 1, 2, and 3 connections

          o  Initiates outgoing LU Type 0, 1, 2, and 3 connections

          o  Establishes and terminates sessions

          o  Transmits and receives data

          o  Implements the protocols for chaining, bracketing, responses, and
             session and data flow control

          o  On Tru64 UNIX systems, the API is Pthreads safe

          o  Supports TCP/IP and DECnet[TM] networks on Tru64 UNIX and OpenVMS
             systems

          The API provides integrated block mode access and VT[TM] emulation.
          In this way, applications written to use the API can also be run in-
          teractively by 3270 users while running MEP VT from INTEC. For more
          information, see the Optional Products section of this Software Prod-
          uct Description.

          Print Symbiont (OpenVMS Only)

          The 3270 Application Services software provides a 3270 OpenVMS print
          symbiont for printing local ASCII files on an SNA-attached LU Type 1
          or Type 3 printer or a non-SNA-attached LU Type 0 printer from an Open-
          VMS print queue.

          The 3270 OpenVMS print symbiont allows system managers to initiate and
          start OpenVMS print queues. Users can print files on SNA-attached print-
          ers. The following features are available for OpenVMS users:

          o  Burst, flag, and trailer pages

          o  Print form specification

          o  Automatic session establishment, retry on error

          o  LU Type 1 printer console commands

          o  DCL queue management commands

          Other features of the print symbiont include:

          o  Prints all types of sequential RMS files, including FORTRAN and Print
             file types, except for non-PRN VFC files.

          o  Data can be sent to the printer untranslated and unformatted. This
             is useful if the printer is an ASCII printer attached to the SNA
             network. This is supported only for LU Type 1 printers.

          o  The symbiont can either pass through escape sequences or strip them
             out.

          o  Translation can be controlled on a queue-by-queue basis. In this
             way, sites that need to use multiple translation tables are accom-
             modated.

          o  Certain IBM applications keep the printers bound unless they get
             a NOTIFY indication in the C(D)INIT. Connections are now queued un-
             til the application unbinds.

          o  The symbiont uses the FORM qualifier to set the size of the mar-
             gins. Text that goes beyond those margins is truncated.

          DECforms for 3270 Terminals (OpenVMS Only)

          Compaq SNA 3270 Application Services provides support for the DECforms
          (Version 1.4) product to enable the development of forms-oriented ap-
          plications that can be accessed by SNA networked 3270 terminal and PC
          users. These DECforms applications can be developed without knowledge
          of 3270 Data Stream, SNA, or the Compaq SNA Application Services soft-
          ware. DECforms is Compaq's implementation of the ANSI/ISO standard for
          a Form Interface Management System (FIMS). Refer to the DECforms Soft-
          ware Product Description (SPD 29.90.xx) for additional information.


          Application Testing Tools

          The Compaq SNA Domain Gateway is required for 3270 access; however,
          a 3270 Terminal Emulator provides a method for preliminary testing of
          incoming sessions by emulating the SLU side of a session. For exam-
          ple, testing can be done with the Compaq SNA 3270 Terminal Emulator
          for OpenVMS (SPD 26.84.xx) or the Compaq DECwindows SNA 3270 Termi-
          nal Emulator for OpenVMS (SPD 31.58.xx).

          The Compaq SNA 3270 Application Services SNALOG trace utility provides
          debugging facilities to debug applications layered on Compaq SNA 3270
          Application Services.

          Thread Safe

          Under Tru64 UNIX, the interface is fully thread safe and can be used
          by a multithreaded program.

          INSTALLATION

          Installation services from Compaq are recommended for a customer's first
          purchase of this software product. These services provide for instal-
          lation of the software product by an experienced software specialist.

          MEP VT for Compaq SNA 3270 Applications Services
          (OpenVMS VAX only)

          The MEP VT product from INTEC is an OpenVMS terminal emulation soft-
          ware package that allows 3270 users to access unmodified applications
          on OpenVMS systems. MEP VT provides full-screen access to OpenVMS ap-
          plications including ALL-IN-1[TM], OpenVMS based customer applications,
          and utilities such as OpenVMS Mail.

          In addition, the 3270 user can run 3270-ready API applications in block
          mode from the MEP VT. This provides the benefits of block mode access
          while accessing the program through a VT emulation terminal session.
