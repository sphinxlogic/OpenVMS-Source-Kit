PRODUCT NAME:  Compaq TeamRoute V1.3A for ALL-IN-1 V3.2        SPD:
33.75.04

DESCRIPTION

Compaq[TM]TeamRoute V1.3A for ALL-IN-1[TM]V3.2 is an electronic doc-
ument initiation, routing, approval, and tracking system. It works be-
tween members of an organisation distributed across wide-area and/or
local-area networks. It is designed to accommodate the primary attributes
of paper-based document processing systems with the added flexibil-
ity, security, and efficiency common to electronic processing systems.
The design considers the diverse and ever-changing needs of an orga-
nization's administrative systems.

This version, V1.3A, of TeamRoute for ALL-IN-1 V3.2 is the only ver-
sion that is Year 2000 Ready and as such supersedes earlier versions
of TeamRoute on prior versions of ALL-IN-1.

Compaq TeamRoute uses the master routing package as the model for gath-
ering, disseminating, processing, and presenting information. It al-
lows an end user to select a template from a library of templates, cre-
ate a new routing package from that template, specify the routing list,
enter information into applicable fields, attach any relevant infor-
mation, and route the master routing package and any attachments to
users or other applications for processing and/or approval/disapproval.

Compaq TeamRoute supports interaction among a heterogeneous group of
clients and among multiple server domains. Microsoft[R] Windows[R] clients
are supported using the TeamLinks V3.0 client software (SPD 55.49).
Video Terminals (VTs) are supported by the TeamRoute ALL-IN-1 client
hosted by ALL-IN-1. The TeamRoute for ALL-IN-1 V1.3A client requires
ALL-IN-1 Version 3.2 OpenVMS Alpha or VAX product.

                                                      October, 1999

Compaq TeamRoute V1.3A for ALL-IN-1 V3.2             SPD: 33.75.04


Compaq TeamRoute is accessible as a separate subsystem of ALL-IN-1.
Routing packages are received, filed, and organized in a separate in-
box within the user's File Cabinet. The VT user chooses TeamRoute from
the ALL-IN-1 main menu to enter the system. TeamLinks users gain ac-
cess by a button on the button bar or via the TeamRoute icon. Team-
Route uses ALL-IN-1 nicknames.

TeamRoute allows routing of documents within departmental local-area
networks, and across wide-area, store-and-forward networks by utiliz-
ing a variety of messaging backbones such as Compaq's MAILbus[TM] 400
and Message Router products or Innosoft's PMDF[R].

Features

o  API

A public Application Programming Interface (API), which allows users
to create linkages with new and existing applications, is documented
in the TeamRoute Programming Guide.

o  Templates

Master routing packages are produced from modifiable templates. Mod-
ifiable temlates and routing package ownership allows users to stip-
ulate routing policies and receipt actions for a master routing pack-
age.

o  Sample Applications

TeamRoute provides several sample applications in the form of pre-defined
templates. These sample applications demonstrate the capabilities of
TeamRoute and can be used by users with or without modifications. The
sample applications include: Action Item, Document Review, Read and
Acknowledge, Telephone Call Slip, Account Request, Meeting Notice, Ask
a Question, and Travel Request.

o  Routing Packages

A routing package is the object that is created by the initiator and
routed to recipients. It is created by selecting a template and fill-
ing out the routing list, adding attachments, and signing it. The rout-
ing package at this point becomes the "Master" and is stored in the

                                 2

initiator's File Cabinet on the server. Routing copies are sent to re-
cipients who can add attachments or modify the routing list of the mas-
ter copy. Recipients can save their copies in their own personal File
Cabinets. The master gets updated throughout the lifecycle of the rout-
ing package.

o  User Roles and Policies

During the lifecycle of a routing package, all participants play one
or more specified roles. For example, a user may be an approver at one
step and a carbon copy (cc:) recipient at another step. Roles are as-
signed by the routing package initiator or template designer. Roles
are defined by a set of rights (what a user can do), requirements (what
a user must do), and optionally, the name of an application to invoke.

o  Routing Package Tracking

Tracking can be requested for any routing package stored in a user's
File Cabinet. When tracking is requested, the Server sends a new car-
bon copy of the master in its current state.

A routing package's history is used to monitor its progress. The events
logged in the routing package history include: when signatures are ap-
plied, if the application was run, when copies were sent, and when up-
dates were applied.

o  Routing

Routing is defined by a routing list. The Server sends routing pack-
ages according to the position of the recipients in the routing list.
It updates the master when it receives a revised copy from a recip-
ient, and then sends a new copy to the next recipient on the list. The
routing list is created by the routing package initiator or the tem-
plate designer. However, the path a routing package takes during its
lifecycle may differ from the one specified in the original routing
list because someone along the way may modify it. Serial and carbon-
copy parallel routing are both available.

An attachment is any additional file or document that is routed with
the master routing package. When a file or document is attached, the
server marks that attachment with the name of the user adding the at-
tachment, an attachment ID, the date and time of addition, a user- pro-
vided subject label, attachment, data type, and file name. The date
and time of addition is the local date and time.

o  Signatures

Signatures is a password-protected function that indicates approval,
disapproval, or acknowledgment of a routing package. If an attachment
is subsequently removed or a key field value altered, the signature
becomes invalid. When users sign a routing package, TeamRoute adds their
name, the date and time, any added remarks, and the approval action.
Recipients viewing signatures are shown whether the signature remains
valid.

o  Help

Users can get help for TeamRoute by using the Help facility. Help pro-
vides basic information on how to perform the function in question with-
out the user having to reference the documentation.

o  Printing

TeamRoute takes advantage of the printing facilities provided by the
underlying ALL-IN-1 system. The user can specify the printer desti-
nation and options.

o  Editing

TeamRoute allows the VT user to specify their editor of choice sup-
ported by ALL-IN-1 Electronic Mail. TeamLinks users may specify their
wordprocessor of choice from those installed on their PC.

o  System Management

TeamRoute for ALL-IN-1 provides a separate management utility. Invok-
ing these utilities allows cluster- wide system management operations
to be managed centrally.

ing standard OpenVMS utilities.

o  Documentation

Documentation of the installation, system management, programming, and
user procedures is included with the individual kits.
