PRODUCT NAME:  Compaq Storage Library System           SPD 29.67.24
               Version 2.9G for OpenVMS

DESCRIPTION

Data center managers face major storage management problems: system
backup and restore complexity and effective file archiving and retrieval.
Compaq Storage Library System (SLS) for OpenVMS provides the solution
for OpenVMS environments.

SLS for OpenVMS includes a remote backup facility for OpenVMS clients.
Features

o  Automatic, flexible scheduling of backup operations

o  Centralized services for user-requested backup and archiving op-
   erations

o  Can be used for remote backup and archiving operations directly be-
   tween disks and tape drives located on different OpenVMS systems
   within a DECnet or DECnet Plus network without staging data across
   disks

o  Online maintenance of information about backed up and archived files
   and volumes; this allows quick retrieval of the files or restora-
   tion of disk volumes without the user having to know the names of
   the tape volumes on which the data was saved

o  Can be used for OpenVMS systems in both mixed-interconnect and mixed
   architecture OpenVMS Clusters

o  Integration with RMU/BACKUP and RMU/RESTORE, allowing backup and
   restore of Oracle Rdb[TM] databases using SLS managed media

                                                     September 2002

                                                        AE-RT6TA-TE

 

o  Effective use of all media capacity by appending multiple sets of
   backed up or archived files to the same volume or volume set

o  Direct positioning to the start of each save set file during a re-
   store operation using saved information about the tape position of
   each save set file. SLS does not qualify SCSI fast tape position-
   ing

o  DCL and menu interfaces with online help for users, operators, and
   storage administrators

o  Customization features to meet a variety of operational and site
   requirements

SLS for OpenVMS provides the following important media and device man-
agement capabilities:

o  Qualified for unattended backup operations using a variety of au-
   tomated libraries and loaders. For a complete list of qualified de-
   vices, refer to the section 'Qualified Devices' of this SPD.

o  Media life cycle control including maintenance of volume retention
   period, availability status, location, and scheduling of dates when
   volumes are to move offsite and return

o  Maintenance of counters for each volume noting the number of times
   a volume has been mounted and the number of errors associated with
   the volume; these counters are used to schedule volume cleaning when
   the counters exceed threshold values

o  Control of media allocation based on customer-defined media pools

o  Ability to print external tape labels in a customized format

o  Built-in report generation and custom report generation capabil-
   ity

o  Security features to prevent unauthorized media or device use

o  "Round robin" device allocation to distribute drive usage among avail-
   able tape drives

                                 2

 

o  In an OpenVMS Cluster environment, automatic failure recovery from
   the loss of a processor to allow continuous access to the SLS for
   OpenVMS media databases. This feature requires two server licenses.

Remote Device Facility (RDF[TM])

The Remote Device Facility (RDF) software is included within the SLS
for OpenVMS software. It is optionally installed during the SLS soft-
ware installation procedure. No additional license is needed for RDF
when used within the bounds of SLS.

RDF allows SLS to access tapes from other OpenVMS nodes across the DEC-
net or DECnet-Plus network for backup and archive operations. RDF in-
cludes of the following capability:

o  RDF servers that execute tape I/O requests on behalf of a remote
   client. Servers are located on systems that have tape drives at-
   tached or on systems that can access drives through the OpenVMS TM-
   SCP Server.

o  RDF clients that provide the communications interface between ap-
   plications reading or writing data to a tape drive and to the RDF
   servers.

SLS for OpenVMS software makes access to remote tape drives transpar-
ent to SLS backup and archive operations by issuing RDF commands as
appropriate if a designated tape drive is a remote one. SLS for Open-
VMS software also manages volume load requests to remote systems to
allow unattended backups or to communicate with a console operator.
SLS for OpenVMS makes no direct use of the remote disk capabilities
inherent in RDF.

LICENSE OPTIONS

To qualify a variety of configuration requirements, the following SLS
for OpenVMS license options are available:

o  SLS for OpenVMS VAX Server

o  SLS for OpenVMS Alpha Server

                                 3

 

o  SLS for OpenVMS VAX Client

o  SLS for OpenVMS Alpha Client

SLS for OpenVMS VAX and OpenVMS Alpha Server

SLS for OpenVMS server software provides full functionality, as de-
scribed above, to users on the node or OpenVMS Cluster on which SLS
is executing. A node or OpenVMS Cluster executing SLS for OpenVMS soft-
ware provides media management services for itself and for any "client
nodes" connected to it. At least one SLS for OpenVMS server license
in the network is required for use of the SLS for OpenVMS product.

SLS for OpenVMS VAX and Alpha Clients

SLS for OpenVMS Client software provides backup scheduling and archiv-
ing services for the node or OpenVMS Cluster on which it is execut-
ing, and acts as a client of the SLS server software when the client
requires media management services.

Like the SLS Sever software, the SLS Client software maintains SLS his-
tory files where it records information about user files backed up or
archived locally under its control. The node executing SLS for Open-
VMS client software communicates using DECnet or DECnet-Plus software
to a node running the SLS for OpenVMS server software. The SLS server
node maintains the SLS media database. The SLS media database contains
information about volume location and pool access authorization.

Each SLS for OpenVMS client node must be reached from a node or Open-
VMS Cluster system executing the SLS for OpenVMS server software. Any
number of SLS for OpenVMS client nodes may be served by a single SLS
for OpenVMS server node.

HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS

SLS runs on VAX and Alpha processors qualified by OpenVMS. For a de-
tailed list of processors qualified by OpenVMS, see the OpenVMS Op-
erating System Software Product Description (SPD 25.01.xx).


                                 4

 

As with OpenVMS, the following processors are not qualified:

o  MicroVAX I

o  VAXstation I

o  VAX-11/725

o  VAX-11/782

o  VAXstation 8000

Processor Restrictions:

A minimum system configuration includes:

o  4 MB memory

o  One or more tape drives

o  Disk drive, recognized by OpenVMS as having a Files-11 structure

o  Any other minimum configuration requirements for the OpenVMS Op-
   erating system

SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS

Operating System:

SLS is qualified on:

o  OpenVMS VAX Operating System, Versions 6.2, 7.1, 7.2 and 7.3.

o  OpenVMS Alpha Operating System, Versions 6.2, 7.1-2, 7.2-1, 7.2-
   2, 7.3 and 7.3-1.

Note: SLS V2.9G does not utilize ODS5 disk structure. SLS V2.9G is not
supported on OpenVMS 5.5-2.
OpenVMS Versions 7.2-2, 7.3 and 7.3-1 provides support for Fibre Chan-
nel (FC) connected tape devices. This is accomplished through the use
of Modular Data Router (MDR) or Network Storage Router (NSR) connected
to the FC Switch. Either router converts Fibre Channel protocol to SCSI
protocl, which the tape device understands.

                                 5

 

SLS V2.9G has qualified this feature in OpenVMS 7.3 as used with MDR
and NSR (Network Storage Router). SLS V2.9G is restricted to single
cluster environment. Please refer to OpenVMS V7.3 SPD(s) for a com-
plete listing of supported tape devices.

Disk space required by the SLS for OpenVMS media database and history
files:

The SLS media database is present only on nodes executing SLS for Open-
VMS server software (not on nodes executing SLS for OpenVMS client soft-
ware). The disk space required by the SLS media database depends on
the number of pieces of media to be managed. During installation, you
may designate the disk on which the SLS media database will be kept.
For enhanced data safety, the SLS media database may be stored on a
shadowed disk.

SLS history files are present on any node executing either SLS for Open-
VMS server software or SLS for OpenVMS client software. The disk space
required for a SLS history file depends upon the number of files to
be tracked by SLS for OpenVMS software. During installation, you may
designate the disk on which SLS history files are will be kept. For
enhanced data safety, the SLS history files may be stored on a shad-
owed disk.

Total Disk Space Requirement for SLS for OpenVMS Server Software:

Execution of SLS for OpenVMS Server software requires approximately
8,400 blocks (the number of blocks occupied by SLS for OpenVMS and RDF
software) plus one block for every piece of media it manages plus one
block for every six files it tracks.


                                 7

 

Example: Assume that there are 1,500 pieces of media under management
by SLS for OpenVMS software and that 60,000 files are tracked. The space

Qualified DEVICES

The following libraries and loaders have been tested and qualified by
Storage Management Software Engineering. However, Storage Management
Software Engineering does not test each of the devices with every pos-
sible combination of controllers and host systems. Because Storage Li-
brary System and the Media Robot Utility (MRU) run in common environ-
ments, these combinations are tested first with MRU. Upon successful
completion of the MRU tests, Storage Library System is then tested in
representative configurations. Note that MRU is not a prerequisite for
Storage Library System.

Therefore, to determine if your specific configuration has been qual-
ified follow these steps:

1. If you have a tape drive that is not software-defined as a juke-
   box (is not a library or a loader device), refer to the OpenVMS Soft-
   ware Product Description (SPD 25.01.xx) to determine if your tape
   drive is qualified for your platform and controller/adapter com-
   bination.

2. If your device is software-defined as a jukebox (it is a library
   or loader device), first check the following list to determine if
   it is tested by the media manager. If the device is listed, see the
   following instructions:

   a. Check the OpenVMS Software Product Description (SPD 25.01.xx)
      to make sure the tape drive(s) in your library/loader are qual-
      ified for your platform and controller/adapter combination.

   b. Check the MRU Software Product Description (SPD 64.44.xx) to make
      sure your library/loader is listed by MRU for your specific con-
      troller/adapter combination.


                                12

 

3. Assuming your device is correctly connected and configured, it should
   work with Storage Library System and its clients.

If you have devices that are not shown on the list, they may still have
been qualified. Compaq continually tests its software on additional
devices that may have been released since the last publication of this
SPD. If you have a question about a particular device, contact Com-
paq customer support.
