   PRODUCT NAME:  Compaq DATATRIEVE Version 7.2A for OpenVMS VAX Systems
   SPD 24.44.32

   DESCRIPTION

   Compaq[TM]DATATRIEVE [TM] for OpenVMS[TM] VAX[TM] systems is a query,
   report, and data management tool for the OpenVMS Operating System. It
   provides a uniform access method for data stored by RMS[TM], Oracle Rdb[TM],
   and Oracle CODASYL DBMS[TM] files on OpenVMS and data residing in other
   databases accessible by the Oracle Rdb Transparent Gateway[TM] prod-
   ucts. Using DATATRIEVE, a novice or experienced user can retrieve or
   modify data without considering the underlying storage method or phys-
   ical location.

   Modes of Operation

   DATATRIEVE presents information in several different formats. Infor-
   mation can be displayed using simple defaults or can be reported on
   through a more flexible report writer. Information can be displayed
   on a terminal or workstation, printed on a hard-copy device, or writ-
   ten to a file. Information can also be presented graphically with user-
   defined VAX FMS[TM] and VAX TDMS[TM] forms, as well as with DECforms[TM].
   Graphics output is ReGIS[TM]; it can be managed by devices or convert-
   ers accepting ReGIS. DATATRIEVE also provides an efficient way to ac-
   cess information stored on other VAX, Alpha or PDP[TM]-11 systems linked
   by DECnet[TM].

   DATATRIEVE can be used interactively to retrieve, modify, store, or
   delete data using a simple set of commands. Frequently used combina-
   tions of commands can be stored as named procedures and invoked by name.

                                                         February 2000

                                                           AE-PVM0F-TE

 

   Programs written in other Compaq languages can call DATATRIEVE, al-
   lowing them to be independent of underlying data storage methods and
   physical location.

   A Compaq DECwindows[TM] Motif[R] interface to DATATRIEVE is provided.
   This allows the user to perform a subset of the DATATRIEVE functions
   using menu bars, scroll bars, pop-up menus, pull-down menus, and but-
   tons. The user can also use a navigator to browse through the dictio-
   nary directories, select objects, and execute commands on them directly
   from pop-up menus.

   Data Dictionary

   DATATRIEVE is dictionary driven. DATATRIEVE has removed the dependen-
   cies from Oracle CDD/Repository by supporting a new textfile dictio-
   nary in addition to Oracle CDD/Repository. DATATRIEVE provides the fol-
   lowing two independent dictionary alternatives:

   o  Data Dictionary using Oracle CDD/Repository for OpenVMS.

   o  DATATRIEVE textfile-based dictionary.

   Data Dictionary using Oracle CDD/Repository for OpenVMS

   Using this dictionary, data descriptions are stored in and retrieved
   from Oracle CDD/Repository for OpenVMS. DATATRIEVE includes commands
   to store, examine, modify, and delete definitions in the dictionary
   and can use definitions stored by other layered products, such as the
   Oracle CODASYL DBMS schema definitions or the Oracle Rdb for OpenVMS
   database definitions. DATATRIEVE requires the Oracle/CDD Repository
   in order to manage the Oracle CODASYL DBMS databases.

   DATATRIEVE fully supports CDO format dictionaries, including the abil-
   ity to access shareable fields. Pieces tracking is also supported for
   these entities. DATATRIEVE includes full support for DMU format dic-
   tionaries as well.




                                    2

 

   Textfile-based Dictionary

   If Oracle CDD/Repository is present on the system, you can select, at
   installation time, whether to link DATATRIEVE with Oracle CDD/Repository
   or not. When Oracle CDD/Repository is linked to DATATRIEVE, its use
   can dynamically be disabled and enabled at run-time by using the SET
   CDD and SET NO CDD commands. When Oracle CDD/Repository is not linked
   to DATATRIEVE, the alternative textfile dictionary is enabled.

   The new textfile dictionary stores the DATATRIEVE object definitions
   as text in text files.

   Oracle CDD/Repository object definitions can be extracted and rede-
   fined as files in the new dictionary system. Text file definitions can-
   not be shared with compilers and database systems, but can be accessed
   and manipulated by applications and OpenVMS utilities.

   Temporary Definition of Objects

   DATATRIEVE extends the use of the DECLARE command to define DATATRIEVE
   objects. Such objects are temporary (time scope is within a DATATRIEVE
   session) and do not depend on any dictionary system, as they are stored
   in memory.

   Protection

   o  Protection with Oracle CDD/Repository

      When DATATRIEVE accesses data through data definitions stored by
      Oracle CDD/Repository for OpenVMS, protection provided by Oracle
      CDD/Repository applies. An Access Control List associated with an
      object definition specifies which types of access are granted to
      the definition itself, and to the defined data. Standard OpenVMS
      Access Elements can be used based on usernames, UICs, and identi-
      fiers. Access rights for terminals can be specified also.

   o  Protection with the DATATRIEVE resident dictionary using text files



                                    3

 

      Text file definitions are subject to the OpenVMS ACL protections,
      and must be defined and managed by the programmer, using the ap-
      propriate DATATRIEVE or OpenVMS commands.

   o  Protection with in-memory temporary object definitions

      In-memory temporary object definitions do not use any protection
      mechanisms, and bypass those definitions defined by either Oracle
      CDD/Repository or the textfile dictionary.

   Remote Data Access

   DATATRIEVE provides access to data on remote systems in two ways as
   follows:

   o  Takes advantage of the remote data access functionality transpar-
      ently provided by the individual data base management systems (for
      example, RMS remote files, Oracle Rdb remote databases) according
      to their rules.

   o  Requests a DATATRIEVE server to start on the remote system (Open-
      VMS Alpha and VAX systems or PDP-11) to manage the data definitions
      and process data remotely. Most operations are performed on the server
      node and only selected data is exchanged between the requester and
      the server systems. To work in this way, a DATATRIEVE (Version 7.2A
      system must be installed on the server node.

   For the Nonprogrammer

   DATATRIEVE provides the novice user with a tutorial mode called GUIDE
   Mode.

   DATATRIEVE offers ADT (Application Design Tool) for the more experi-
   enced user who wants to define data structures. ADT takes the user step-
   by-step through the definition of a domain based on an RMS data file.

   If DATATRIEVE is used on the same information by experienced and novice
   users, the novice user can use the full power of the language by in-
   voking procedures designed by the more experienced user.

                                    4

 

   For the Programmer

   DATATRIEVE is a highly structured language that provides automatic ac-
   cess optimization, data type conversion, and data validation. Loop-
   ing and control structures, such as IF THEN ELSE, BEGIN END, REPEAT,
   WHILE, CHOICE and FOR (each record) can be combined and nested to cre-
   ate complex, powerful procedures.

   DATATRIEVE responds to programming errors with clear, explicit error
   messages. The user can issue an EDIT command to invoke a text editor
   with an erroneous statement as input text, correct the mistake, and
   resubmit the command. This editor can be either EDT, TPU, or DEC Language-
   Sensitive Editor (LSE) and is controlled by a user logical name as-
   signment.

   Data Definition

   DATATRIEVE stores the fixed attributes of each record in the record
   definition. In addition to COBOL-like attributes, DATATRIEVE allows
   validation criteria, fields whose values are computed at run-time, miss-
   ing value expressions, and default values.

   DATATRIEVE supports most data types used by Compaq Fortran[TM], COBOL,
   VAX PL/I, Compaq C, and Compaq BASIC[TM]. DATATRIEVE also supports Vary-
   ing String and Segmented String data types in Oracle Rdb for OpenVMS
   databases.

   Views

   A VIEW is an alternative description of data. It can be used to al-
   low a user access to a subset of the data items in a record. It can
   restrict a user by including only some of the data items in a record,
   or it can combine data items from several files. Information can be
   linked through common values (or set linkages in Oracle CODASYL DBMS)
   to produce complex hierarchical structures. Using a predefined VIEW,
   a user can access and display data from several files at once with the
   same commands used on a single file. Data accessed through a VIEW can
   be printed and modified, but data cannot be stored or erased using a
   VIEW.

                                    5

 

   Call Interface

   DATATRIEVE provides a client/server API. The DATATRIEVE Client libraries
   for OpenVMS and Windows[TM] systems are supplied with the kit of the
   DATATRIEVE product for OpenVMS systems, and can be copied freely to
   Client systems.

   DATATRIEVE can be accessed from the following programs:

   o  Programs linked with DATATRIEVE, residing on the same node and pro-
      cess space where DATATRIEVE resides, and written in high-level lan-
      guages such as Compaq Fortran, Compaq C, COBOL, Compaq BASIC, Com-
      paq Pascal[TM], and VAX PL/I.

   o  Programs linked with a DATATRIEVE client library, residing on dif-
      ferent nodes or platforms, and written in Visual C++[R], Visual Basic[R]
      or OpenVMS program languages.

   DATATRIEVE automatically converts data from its storage format to the
   format expected by the program.

   DATATRIEVE Client for Windows[TM]

   The DATATRIEVE Client/Server architecture allows existing DATATRIEVE
   users to downsize and distribute their applications and interactive
   DATATRIEVE operations.

   The DATATRIEVE Client for Windows, previously a separately orderable
   package, is now included with the server software.

   The DATATRIEVE Client for Windows offers a graphical user interface
   that permits users to:

   o  Browse through the dictionary from a Windows desktop.

   o  Access, modify, and execute their existing DATATRIEVE procedures
      and dictionary objects.

   o  Access the DATATRIEVE language for interactive queries using a query
      editor.

   o  Operate on data: display, modify, and store.

                                    6

 

   o  Interoperate (data import/export) with other PC applications.

   DATATRIEVE Client for Windows contains the following features, that
   permit users to:

   o  Use a query-by-example mechanism in the Query Editor. A query can
      be specified by providing constraints on field values and simple
      links between fields, without using the graphical query editor.

   o  Define DATATRIEVE objects using specific dialog boxes that guide
      the creation of the objects themselves.

   o  Use plots. DATATRIEVE Client for Windows PLOT statements produce
      graphic results in the client environment.

   o  Use Client/Server TCP/IP transport in addition to DECnet.

   Storage Methods

   DATATRIEVE uses a single, consistent syntax to provide full access to
   information stored in RMS for OpenVMS sequential or indexed files (RMS
   relative files are supported for queries only), Oracle CODASYL DBMS,
   and Oracle Rdb databases. DATATRIEVE can also provide access to in-
   formation stored in certain IBM[R] mainframe databases through the use
   of Oracle Rdb Transparent Gateway for DB2[TM], as well as information
   stored in ORACLE[R] databases through Oracle Rdb Transparent Gateway
   for Oracle7 & 8, and SYBASE[R] databases through Oracle Rdb Transpar-
   ent Gateway for SYBASE. Data from all these sources can be combined
   into a single VIEW.

   If access to a Oracle CODASYL DBMS database involves explicit set walk-
   ing or if records must be manually connected or disconnected from sets,
   the user can employ DATATRIEVE language features that are specific to
   Oracle CODASYL DBMS access. However, if the user employs VIEWS or im-
   plicit set walking, DATATRIEVE can access information in Oracle CO-
   DASYL DBMS databases using the same syntax used for data from an RMS
   file or Oracle Rdb.



                                    7

 

   Report Generation

   The DATATRIEVE REPORT statement can produce simple formatted reports
   without formatting statements. It also allows the user to override the
   default format when more complex reports are required. Reports can ei-
   ther be page-based, printable documents, or table-based formatted data
   that can be input by a spreadsheet.

   Column headers and, in page-based reports, page headers containing ti-
   tle, date, and page numbers are produced automatically. Simple state-
   ments (AT TOP, AT BOTTOM) create page headers and trailers for con-
   trol breaks, page breaks or a report summary. DATATRIEVE provides all
   of its statistical functions and value expressions within the REPORT
   statement.

   Reports can be output in a variety of output formats: table reports
   are produced in DTIF format, page-based reports are produced in DDIF,
   PostScript[R] and Text formats, and online reports are produced in HTML
   format.

   DATATRIEVE Version 7.2A features a HTML report format that enables you
   to generate a HTML file suitable for loading into a standard Web browser.
   HTML is a markup language used to create hypertext documents that are
   portable across platforms.

   Usage of DDIF and PostScript allows a variety of text attributes (size,
   font types, rendition) to be applied to any part of the report to ob-
   tain a boardroom-quality output. These attributes, and other print-
   ing characteristics such as page size and orientation, can be selected
   from DATATRIEVE through simple statements without requiring the use
   of a graphical terminal. Simple character-cell based reports are also
   available, using the Text format. Using the CDA[TM] converter library,
   DTIF and DDIF reports can be converted to a variety of output formats,
   allowing interoperability with a number of popular applications.

   The CDA Postscript converter is supplied as part of DATATRIEVE Ver-
   sion 7.2A. This packaging eliminates the requirement for a separate
   installation of CDA software or Motif. You can create PostScript re-
   ports using the DATATRIEVE Report Statement.

                                    8

 

   The Report Writer provides two layout tools: a grid printout of the
   CDA report layout with placement of rows and columns, including those
   with varying font types, and graphical printout of the layout page,
   with placement of the different report objects (such as header, footer,
   body).

   Reports can be generated from data stored in RMS files, Oracle CODA-
   SYL DBMS and Oracle Rdb databases. Reports can also be generated from
   other databases accessed through the use of the appropriate Oracle Rdb
   Transparent Gateway or DATATRIEVE VIEWS that combine any of these databases
   without any change in the syntax of the REPORT statement.

   Graphics

   DATATRIEVE includes a number of predefined plots invoked with a sin-
   gle command that takes standard record selection expressions as ar-
   guments and creates bar, pie, line, and scattered point plots of the
   information selected. Plots can be displayed on Compaq Computer Cor-
   poration Graphics terminals such as the VT340 (refer to the OPTIONAL
   HARDWARE section for a list of specific supported terminals). Hard copy
   can be obtained from terminals by attaching a Compaq device which sup-
   ports the SIXEL protocol (for example, LA50, LA75). For users with DECwin-
   dows, graphics can be displayed in DECterm windows.

   The DATATRIEVE Client for Windows can display, process, modify, print
   plots created by the plot statement, and export the plot using the clip-
   board to other applications. Printing to postscript printers is also
   supported.

   Compatibility

   DATATRIEVE for OpenVMS VAX systems and DATATRIEVE for OpenVMS Alpha
   systems are highly compatible, with the exception of the support for
   floating point definitions, typical of the Alpha platform.






                                    9

 

   DATATRIEVE is largely upward compatible from DATATRIEVE-11. DATATRIEVE-
   11 provides a utility that extracts the contents of a DATATRIEVE-11
   dictionary in a format to be entered into Oracle CDD/Repository for
   OpenVMS. Some syntactic and semantic differences do exist between DATATRIEVE-
   11 and DATATRIEVE. Procedures copied with the EXTRACT utility can re-
   quire modification.

   A user on a DATATRIEVE Version 7.2A can only ready a domain on a re-
   mote node when DATATRIEVE Version 7.2A is also installed on that node
   also. This requirement is new to DATATRIEVE Version 7.2A.

   Memory Requirements for DECwindows Support

   The minimum supported memory for this application running in a stan-
   dalone DECwindows environment with both the client and server execut-
   ing on that same system is 8M bytes.

   The performance and memory usage of DECwindows applications are par-
   ticularly sensitive to system configuration. Less memory may be re-
   quired on the client system (the system where the software is installed
   and executed) if the server (the component that displays the appli-
   cation) resides on another system. More memory may be required on a
   system with several applications running, or where it may be desir-
   able to improve the performance of an application.

   OPTIONAL HARDWARE

   Graphics can be displayed on VT125, VT240, VT241, VT330, and VT340 ter-
   minals only. For users with DECwindows, graphics can be displayed in
   DECterm windows.
