Compaq DECset for OpenVMS VAX Systems Components

Compaq Language-Sensitive Editor/Source Code
Analyzer for OpenVMS VAX Systems:

Language-Sensitive Editor

The Language-Sensitive Editor (LSE) is a multilanguage programmer's
editor. Language-specific templates and online language help assist
both new and experienced programmers in developing programs faster.
With LSE, users can efficiently edit, compile, review diagnostic in-
formation from compilations, and correct compile time errors without
exiting the editor. LSE also enables users to customize and extend their
editing environment.

Programmers can perform low-level program designs with LSE by embed-
ding pseudocode in source code. Users can also view source code at var-
ious levels of detail by replacing a sequence of source lines with a
single overview line.

LSE provides an interface via callable routines, as well as through
the LSE command-line interface and the DECwindows Motif for OpenVMS
VAX interface.

Note: The following LSE-supported compilers are available on the Open-
VMS VAX platform:

    DEC Ada for OpenVMS VAX Systems
    Compaq BASIC for OpenVMS VAX Systems
    Compaq C for OpenVMS VAX Systems
    Compaq C++ for OpenVMS VAX Systems
    Compaq COBOL for OpenVMS VAX Systems
    Compaq Fortran 77 for OpenVMS VAX Systems
    Compaq Pascal for OpenVMS VAX Systems
    VAX PL/1 for OpenVMS VAX Systems

The following VAX products partially support LSE (refer to product SPDs
for more details); the templates are included with the product:

   Compaq ACMS (SPD 25.50.xx)

                                 3

 

   DEC DATATRIEVE (SPD 24.44.xx)

Note: Certain LSE featuers are not available when using language pre-
processors, such as those supplied for Oracle Rdb.

LSE works in conjunction with CMS, SCA, and the
OpenVMS VAX Debugger to provide a highly interactive, online environ-
ment that facilitates the NAVIGATE-EDIT-COMPILE-DEBUG portion of the
program development cycle. DECset users can directly reserve and re-
place files from CMS while in LSE, go to the exact source code loca-
tion in LSE from SCA, and go to the exact source code location in LSE
from the OpenVMS VAX Debugger.

Source Code Analyzer

The Source Code Analyzer (SCA) aids programmers in understanding the
complexities of software systems. Because it allows users to analyze
an entire system, as opposed to individual modules, and it helps users
understand unfamiliar systems, SCA is extremely useful during both the
implementation and maintenance phases of a project.

SCA provides navigation capabilities to assist users in locating and
viewing components of their source code. SCA accomplishes this by stor-
ing compiler-generated information about a set of source files in an
SCA library. SCA then allows users to perform queries about their source
code in the following ways:

o  Using a name browser to locate all items that match a search string.

o  Specifying a cross-reference query to find how and where program
   symbols are used.

o  Specifying a call graph query to graphically display call relation-
   ships between routines.

o  Specifying a data structure query to graphically display the struc-
   ture of data types in the source code or to find symbols of a given
   type.


                                 4

 

User controlled marking of items of interest is provided so users can
mark items to be queried and save that information to a command file
to be reused.

After users have a query result, they can use the go-to-source fea-
ture to navigate to locations of interest in their source code.

SCA also provides static analysis capabilities to assist users in check-
ing for consistent use of program symbols.

SCA provides an interface via callable routines, as well as through
the SCA command-line interface and the DECwindows Motif for OpenVMS
VAX interface.

Note: The following SCA-supported compilers are available on the Open-
VMS VAX platform:

    DEC Ada for OpenVMS VAX Systems
    Compaq BASIC for OpenVMS VAX Systems
    Compaq C for OpenVMS VAX Systems
    Compaq COBOL for OpenVMS VAX Systems
    Compaq Fortran 77 for OpenVMS VAX Systems *
    Compaq Pascal for OpenVMS VAX Systems
    VAX MACRO for OpenVMS VAX Systems
    VAX PL/1 for OpenVMS VAX Systems

Note: SCA is not available when using language preprocessors, such as
those supplied for Oracle Rdb.

The following VAX compilers also generate pseudocode and specialized
comment processing information so SCA can produce design reports, cross-
reference and analysis information:

   DEC Ada for OpenVMS VAX Systems
   Compaq BASIC for OpenVMS VAX Systems
   Compaq C for OpenVMS VAX Systems
   Compaq COBOL for OpenVMS VAX Systems
   Compaq Fortran 77 for OpenVMS VAX Systems *
   Compaq Pascal for OpenVMS VAX Systems

fer to the
ORDERING INFORMATION section of this SPD.

Compaq Digital Test Manager for OpenVMS VAX Systems

The Compaq Digital Test Manager for OpenVMS VAX
Systems is a regression testing tool that automates the creation and
maintenance of regression tests. It also automatically compares test
run results with expected test results. The Digital Test Manager pro-
vides users with flexibility in organizing tests, selecting tests for
execution, and verifying and reviewing test results. With the Digi-
tal Test Manager users can:

o  Test batch and command line applications.

o  Create and record tests.

o  Group tests into meaningful combinations.

o  Execute specific tests, groups of tests, or combinations of groups
   of tests.

o  Compare the results of the executed tests with benchmark test re-
   sults to determine differences.

o  View test results interactively.

o  Update benchmarks as needed.

o  Filter test results to ignore output that is expected to change for
   each test execution.

The Digital Test Manager enables users to store software test descrip-
tions and related files in CMS libraries for storage efficiency.

                                 6

 

The Digital Test Manager provides an interface through callable rou-
tines, as well as through the
Digital Test Manager command-line interface and the DECwindows Motif
for OpenVMS VAX interface.

The Compaq Digital Test Manager for OpenVMS VAX
Systems is a component of the Compaq DECset for OpenVMS
VAX Systems product and is also available separately. Please refer to
the ORDERING INFORMATION section of this SPD. Compaq Performance and
Coverage Analyzer for OpenVMS VAX Systems

The Compaq Performance and Coverage Analyzer (PCA) for OpenVMS VAX Sys-
tems helps users pinpoint execution bottlenecks in application pro-
grams. PCA can also identify which parts of an application are not ex-
ecuted by a given set of test data. PCA has two components: the Col-
lector, which gathers performance or test coverage data on the run-
ning user program; and the Analyzer, which later processes and dis-
plays the collected data. The Analyzer graphically presents informa-
tion in four types of charts: histograms, tables, annotated source list-
ings, and call trees.

PCA does not analyze operating system performance or aid in hardware
resource planning.

PCA can gather and report on the following types of performance data:

o  Call stacks

o  CPU sampling data

o  Event markers

o  PC sampling data

o  Page fault data

o  System services data

o  Input/Output data

o  Exact execution counts

o  Test coverage data

                                 7

 

o  Ada tasking data

Additional PCA features include the following:

o  Traversing commands to sift through performance data

o  Screen mode to display different types of data in separate windows

o  Multiple data kinds allowing the display of different categories
   of performance data in the same histogram or table

o  Acceptable noncoverage indicating portions of code that are accept-
   ably noncovered to the Analyzer

o  Filtering to analyze only a subset of data

With PCA, users can analyze applications written in any of the fol-
lowing OpenVMS languages:

   DEC Ada for OpenVMS VAX Systems
   Compaq BASIC for OpenVMS VAX Systems
   Compaq C for OpenVMS VAX Systems
   Compaq C++ for OpenVMS VAX Systems
   Compaq COBOL for OpenVMS VAX Systems
   Compaq Fortran 77 for OpenVMS VAX Systems *
   Compaq Pascal for OpenVMS VAX Systems
   VAX PL/1 for OpenVMS VAX Systems

PCA works in concert with LSE and the Digital Test Manager. From the
character-cell version of PCA, users can communicate with LSE and can
examine source code. When used with the Digital Test Manager, PCA can
evaluate the code coverage of a user's test system.

PCA provides a command-line interface and the DECwindows Motif for Open-
VMS VAX interface.

Compaq Performance and Coverage Analyzer for OpenVMS VAX Systems is
a component of the
Compaq DECset for OpenVMS VAX Systems product and is also available

Compaq Code Management System for OpenVMS
VAX Systems

The Compaq Code Management System (CMS) for OpenVMS VAX Systems pro-
vides an efficient method for storing project files and tracking all
changes to those files. Code management is especially important to projects
that have long life spans or several versions of the software.

CMS stores any kind of RMS file, including: documents, plans, spec-
ifications, status reports, source code files, object files, executable
images, sixel files, and other records, and keeps these files in project
libraries. CMS also stores history information. As a project evolves,
CMS tracks changes to the library by storing only the changes made to
a file. Not only does this reduce the amount of disk space used for
storing multiple versions of files, but it also allows CMS to recon-
struct any previous version of a file and to identify the changes made
between any two versions. In addition to storing successive changes,
CMS maintains a record of who is currently working on a library el-
ement and a historical record of library access.

With CMS, users can:

o  Support multiple project libraries.

o  Retrieve previous generations (versions).

o  Delete generations.

o  Obtain a report of file modifications, including when, why, and by
   whom the modification was made.

o  Determine the origin of each line of a file, either as an annotated
   listing or as comments in the file.

o  Manage concurrent modifications.

o  Merge separately developed modifications.

o  Combine related files together as a class (group).

o  Relate the generation of one element to the corresponding gener-
   ations of other elements for purposes of freezing baselines or re-
   leases and for organizing ongoing development.

                                 9

 

o  Interface via callable routines, as well as through the CMS command-
   line interface and the DECwindows Motif for OpenVMS VAX interface.

o  Through the use of CMS access control lists, fine tune security mech-
   anisms applied to CMS libraries, and provide a means of notifica-
   tion about library events.

CMS can act as a project's central repository, by storing and track-
ing source-code files, object code, documentation, and a variety of
files generated by other tools. CMS can store files for MMS and the
Digital Test Manager. LSE and Digital Test Manager users can access
CMS elements directly from within LSE and Digital Test Manager.

VAX Systems is a component of the Compaq DECset for OpenVMS VAX Sys-
tems product and is also available separately. Please refer to the OR-
DERING INFORMATION section of this SPD.

Compaq Module Management System for OpenVMS
VAX Systems

Compaq Module Management System (MMS) for OpenVMS VAX Systems auto-
mates and simplifies the building of software applications, whether
they are simple programs of only one or two files or complex programs
consisting of many source files, message files, and documentation. MMS
can optimize the build process by rebuilding only those components (and
their dependencies) that have changed since the system was last built.
In this way, MMS eliminates the steps of recompiling and linking mod-
ules that have not changed. MMS can automatically generate descrip-
tion files. Once users create a description file containing the rules
describing the relationships among the components of their applica-
tion and the MMS commands to build the application, MMS can build both
small or large systems with a single command.

MMS provides a command-line interface and the DECwindows Motif for Open-
VMS VAX interface.
