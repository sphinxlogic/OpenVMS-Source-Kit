The TP Desktop Connector options include one or more UNSUPPORTED soft-
ware components, which are clearly identified in this Software Prod-
uct Description. These software components are included because they
may be useful for the user; however, they are not supported by Com-
paq Customer Service Centers. Inclusion of these software components


                                 2

 

does not constitute a commitment from Compaq that they will continue
to be provided in this product.

Certain third-party products can be used in conjunction with the TP
Desktop Connector options and are mentioned in this SPD. Third-party
products such as those listed are not provided by this product, nor
are they directly supported by this product.

In general, Compaq does not directly support any third-party products
for use with the TP Desktop Connector options. However, appropriate
versions of certain third-party products have been tested and certi-
fied to be appropriate for use with this product. The Optional Software
section of this document contains a list of these products.

Features: TP Desktop Connector for ACMS

Features are described for the following areas:

o  Development environment

o  Runtime system

o  Network support

o  Management and control

o  Documentation

Development Environment

The TP Desktop Connector for ACMS option provides a set of applica-
tion programming interfaces, along with support libraries, that al-
low software programs to interact with ACMS applications as authen-
ticated clients. These interfaces allow programmers to write client
programs without requiring extensive knowledge of programming ACMS or
network communications.

The TP Desktop Connector for ACMS option provides application program-
ming interfaces for the Microsoft Windows, DOS, Windows 95, Windows
98, Windows NT, Macintosh, OpenVMS, and Tru64 UNIX environments. These
client services allow the desktop programmer to develop programs that:

                                 3

 

o  Sign in to the TP Desktop Connector gateway for client authenti-
   cation

o  Select ACMS tasks for execution under the control of the ACMS Ex-
   ecution Controller

o  Respond to callbacks from the ACMS system as part of ACMS task ex-
   change steps (forms processing)

o  Sign out of the TP Desktop Connector gateway

There are five different programming interfaces available:

o  Automation

o  C-language

o  Java[TM]

o  Client Services

o  Client Services for Macintosh

Automation Interface

The Automation interface supports any desktop tool or Microsoft Of-
fice product that supports Automation. ACMS tasks are presented as Au-
tomation objects.












                                 4

 

C-language Interface

The C-language interface supports any desktop tools that support a C-
callable interface. ACMS TP tasks are presented as callable C proce-
dures.

Java Interface

The Java interface supports any desktop tools that support Java. ACMS
TP tasks are presented as Java objects.

Client Services Interface

The portable client interface provides support for three models of ap-
plication development:

o  Blocking interface where execution of the program is blocked dur-
   ing execution of the TP Desktop Connector gateways, for example,
   Microsoft COBOL on DOS.

o  Nonblocking event-driven interface to accommodate such nonblock-
   ing environments as Motif[R] or Microsoft Windows.

o  Forced nonblocking that facilitates exchange I/O between ACMS tasks
   and desktop tools that do not support call backs.

The services provided by the portable client for Microsoft Windows,
Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows NT, DOS, Tru64 UNIX, and OpenVMS ad-
dress the areas of:

o  Sign in/out services-establish and terminate sessions.

o  Call processing services-send and receive application requests

o  Presentation procedure routines-called automatically by the portable
   client to facilitate forms processing for the desktop user (not sup-
   ported in a forced nonblocking environment).

Client Services for Macintosh Interface

This API supports the Data Access Manager (DAM) facility of the Mac-
intosh operating system. A special DAM device driver (DDEV) provides
services for client execution.

                                 5

 

These services are synchronous; program control returns only when ser-
vice execution is complete. Nonblocking task execution is supported
because the DBExec service completes as soon as the task is submit-
ted for execution to ACMS. The DBState service is used to poll for task
completion.

Runtime System

Client runtime libraries are provided for the client operating sys-
tems to support the execution of client programs that use the prod-
uct's services. The client for Macintosh includes external functions
for HyperCard and 4th DIMENSION[R] applications.




























                                 6

 

The TP Desktop Connector gateway is an asynchronous, multithreaded,
runtime component residing on any OpenVMS node, regardless of the lo-
cation of ACMS applications being called by desktop clients. There is
generally one gateway on a node. The gateway is an ACMS agent that per-
forms the following functions:

o  Authenticates desktop clients (ACMS submitters).

o  Calls tasks for users; this can include local and remote ACMS task
   selection.

o  Communicates with the desktop client program as part of task ex-
   change step (desktop presentation procedure) execution. This func-
   tion is supported by only the client services and client services
   for Macintosh interfaces.

o  Provides information to the system manager concerning TP Desktop
   Connector submitters (For Client Servers interface only).

Network Support

The following network connectivity software is supported (see Soft-
ware Requirements) for desktop nodes connected to a Local Area Net-
work (LAN) or a Wide Area Network (WAN):

o  AppleTalk[R]

o  DECnet

o  IPX/SPX

o  TCP/IP

o  X.25

Note: For OpenVMS clients, a communication module is provided for test
purposes for Novell[R] NetWare[R] but it is UNSUPPORTED.



                                 7

 

Management and Control

The TP Desktop Connector supports the following management and con-
trol features:

o  The client interface reports errors from ACMS back to the desktop
   client program for local error handling.

o  The client interface optionally logs error messages to a local desk-
   top device file.

o  Messages can be protected against sabotage or network corruption
   by adding Cyclic Redundancy Checking (CRC) for the client services
   and client services for Macintosh interfaces only.

o  The gateway reports ACMS and desktop client errors to the ACMS soft-
   ware event logger.























                                 8

 

o  OpenVMS system managers can control desktop client access to ACMS
   and remove desktop clients from the ACMS system, using standard ACMS
   utilities.

o  Provides a graphical user interface to manage parameters required
   for communication with ACMS tasks.

SOFTWARE LICENSING INFORMATION

All TP Desktop Connector options offer Concurrent Use and Personal Use
licensing.

o  Concurrent Use Licensing - The number of Concurrent Use licenses
   determines the number of concurrent logins to any TP application.

                                22

 

   This style of licensing works best and is the most cost effective
   for deployments where users primarily login to only one TP appli-
   cation at a time.

o  Personal Use Licensing - The number of Personal Use licenses de-
   termines the numbers of identified individuals that can access mul-
   tiple TP applications. The main difference between Personal Use and
   Concurrent Use licensing is that Personal Use license permits iden-
   tified individuals to login to multiple TP applications at the same
   time. This style of licensing works best and is the most cost ef-
   fective for deployments where users require simultaneous to access
   multiple TP applications.

This software is furnished only under a license. For more information
about Compaq's licensing terms and policies, contact your local Com-
paq office.

LICENSE MANAGEMENT FACILITY SUPPORT (LMF)

The TP Desktop Connector for ACMS option supports the OpenVMS License
Management Facility. License units for this product are allocated on
a Concurrent Use or Personal Use basis.

A Concurrent Use license allows one login to a TP Desktop Connector
gateway.

A Personal Use license allows one identified individual to have mul-
tiple logins to the same TP Desktop Connector gateway.

For more information on the License Management Facility, refer to the
OpenVMS Operating System Software Product Description (SPD 25.01.xx)
or the License Management Facility manual of the OpenVMS Operating Sys-
tem documentation set.
