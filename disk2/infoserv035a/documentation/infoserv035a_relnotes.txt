       1 InfoServer Software Version 3.5a

            This chapter provides brief descriptions of features that are
            new to the InfoServer System Software in this release or have
            changed significantly from previous releases.


         Installing InfoServer Software V3.5a

            To install the software, log in to the InfoServer system and  
            follow these steps:
  
            1 Insert the distribution compact disc in a drive attached to 
              the InfoServer system or use the BIND command to connect to 
              the compact disc on another InfoServer system in the local
              area network.
  
            2 At the InfoServer> prompt, enter an UPDATE SYSTEM command in 
              the following format, where (n) is the drive number:

              InfoServer> UPDATE SYSTEM DKn: destination-device:


            If you omit the destination device name, the InfoServer
            system uses, in order, one of the following:

            1. FLASH for InfoServer 1000 systems

            2. The device from which the system booted, if the device is 
               writeable

            3. The InfoServer-formatted device with the lowest device number 

            The UPDATE SYSTEM command moves the InfoServer software to the 
            internal read/write device.  The next time you boot the server,
            it runs the new software.  

            Note that if you subscribe to Digital's Consolidated Software 
            Distribution (ConDIST), you can use the disc containing the 
            InfoServer software both to perform the UPDATE SYSTEM operation
            and to boot InfoServer software. (Refer to the ConDIST
            documentation for details.)  Be sure to retain this compact 
            disc in case you need to boot the software in an emergency. 


         V3.5a New Features

            The InfoServer Software V3.5a release includes the following new 
            features:
  
             o Support for the Sony CDU926S CD-R Recorder on InfoServer 150 
               and InfoServer 1000 systems. The CDU926S supports recording at
               1X and 2X speeds and TEST mode. Sony strongly recommends
               recording at 2X speed whenever possible when using the CDU926S.







                                                  Version 3.5a Release Notes 1-1

         InfoServer 1000 Auxiliary Boot File

            To recover from InfoServer 1000 bootstrap failures, follow the
            procedures described in the InfoServer 1000 Installation and
            User's Guide. The procedures require you to enter the name of
            the current auxiliary boot file at the Bootfile: prompt. For 
            InfoServer Software V3.5a, the name of the file is IS1000_V35.


         Problems Fixed in the Version 3.5a Release

            The InfoServer Software V3.5a release fixes the following problems:

            o The InfoServer will properly handle the deletion of temporary
              mop partitions for those discs containing more than twenty mop
              images.  Prior to this release, only the first twenty temporary
              mop partitions created from a specific disc are deleted from
              the hard drive when the disc is removed from the system.  In
              this case, the temporary mop partitions will remain on the 
              hard drive until the system is rebooted.

            o The help file built into the flash image for the InfoServer 1000
              was truncated in the V3.5 release. When obtaining help on SHOW,
              UNBIND, UNLOAD, UPDATE, VERIFY, ZERO, and some SET qualifiers,
              the following message is displayed;

              InfoServer> HELP SHOW
              %ESS-E-NOHELPFOUND, Sorry, no documentation on SHOW

              This problem has been corrected for version 3.5a.

         Change from Previous Behavior

            As of the InfoServer kernel V3.2, the InfoServer software no 
            longer displays tape labels in the SHOW SERVER display.  During
            multi-volume operations, the code to read the tape label left
            the tape drive in an inconsistent state. 


         Current Known Problems and Restrictions

            The InfoServer Software V3.5a release has the following known
            problems and restrictions:
  
            o When creating a disc using the Sony CDU920S, or CDU926S CD 
              writers, the size of the data written to the disc may
              appear greater than the actual block/byte size of the
              source partition or data. This is because the Sony drives 
              expect a full write buffer in order to complete the CD. 

            o The JVC recorder is unable to determine disc capacity in 
              advance and simply continues to record until the disc is full.
              The full state may cause the system to issue an error message
              concerning non-blank media in the drive.
 
            o You must disable a device listed in the remote device list
              before shutting down the server to physically remove the device
              from the system.  Failure to remove the remote device list
              entry will cause the InfoServer to crash upon reboot. 
  

                                                  Version 3.5a Release Notes 1-2


            o Although the SET PARTITION command accepts the wildcard 
              character (*), only the first partition is modified. 

            o A SHOW DEVICE command entered at the InfoServer 1000 console
              prompt ( >>> ) does not show the Sony CDW-900E compact disc
              recorder as configured, even when it is correctly connected.
              However, a SHOW DEVICE command entered at the InfoServer>
              prompt does show the recorder.

            o The RZ23 disk cannot be used as a staging disk for CD-ROM
              recording.

            o A restriction has been implemented to prevent a possible 
              data corruption problem with removable media, such as 
              magneto-optical (MO) devices, that have been formatted using
              the INITIALIZE command.

              An InfoServer-formatted removable device operates normally if 
              it is loaded when the system is booted, or if the device is
              inserted after a system boot and then formatted using the
              INITIALIZE command. 

              The BACKUP and RETRIEVE commands are considered to have issued
              an INITIALIZE command on the destination device. 

              If the device is swapped, or if it is removed and reinserted
              before a reboot, the InfoServer file system does not reuse
              deleted partitions on the device when new partitions are 
              created. Instead, new partitions are created from free space. 


            InfoServer Client for OpenVMS

            The distribution compact disc no longer includes an InfoServer
            Client for OpenVMS software kit, as with previous releases. 
            This software is incorporated in the Version 6.1 and later
            OpenVMS VAX and OpenVMS AXP operating systems. If necessary,
            Digital's Customer Service Centers can provide software patches
            between OpenVMS releases. 


            InfoServer Monitor Software

            InfoServer Monitor Version 2.2 is included on the InfoServer 
            Software V3.5a compact disc. The InfoServer Monitor kit and
            supporting documentation are located in the [INFOMON] directory.
            This is a new release of the InfoServer Monitor for V3.5a.


            F11CD Software

            The F11CD software supporting ISO-9660 file systems on OpenVMS
            VAX V5.5 has been removed from the InfoServer kit. Should you
            require this kit, it is available on previous InfoServer Kernel
            Software CDs or from the Digital Customer Support Center.
            ISO-9660 file system support is supplied with OpenVMS VAX
            Version 6.0 and later and with OpenVMS Alpha Version 1.5 
            and later.


                                                  Version 3.5a Release Notes 1-3
