PRODUCT NAME:  InfoServer Software, Version 3.5        SPD 33.20.12

DESCRIPTION

InfoServer Software is the software component of a special-purpose hard-
ware/software system that makes up an InfoServer Ethernet-based stor-
age server. This product supports locally attached SCSI CD-ROMs, SCSI
disk drives, magneto-optical drives, and SCSI tape drives.

The server contains 4 MB of memory, of which 3 MB can be used for cache.
The InfoServer 1000 system box by itself does not contain any stor-
age, although certain InfoServer 1000 system packages include CD-ROM
drives or hard disks. Note that the InfoServer software and function
updates require either a directly-connected CD-ROM drive or access to
a CD-ROM drive connected to another InfoServer in the LAN.

The rights to connect to the InfoServer are granted with the InfoSer-
ver system license. Supported clients are described in the SOFTWARE
REQUIREMENTS section of this SPD.

Using the InfoServer in a client-server environment, clients can ac-
cess server-based storage. The InfoServer can serve virtual disks, both
physical disk media and sets of logical disk blocks, to the network.
Client systems running appropriate client software can connect to de-
vices served by the InfoServer, and use them as though they were lo-
cally attached devices.

InfoServer 1000 systems are shipped with the Disk Function Access en-
abled. With this function, clients can access and share CD-ROMs, hard
disks, and magneto-optical drives attached to the InfoServer. Please
refer to the OPTIONAL SOFTWARE section of this SPD.

                                                          July 1997

With the Tape Function Access option, OpenVMS clients can also share
SCSI tape devices attached to the InfoServer. Clients can use this fea-
ture to perform remote incremental backup and software distribution
as if the tape devices were locally attached. Full standalone backup
is not supported. Please refer to the OPTIONAL SOFTWARE section of this
SPD.

Specialized software protocols provide access to the server on the LAN.
These protocols are Local Area Transport (LAT) for remote management,
LASTport and LASTport/Disk for virtual disk access, LASTport/Tape for
SCSI tape access, and Maintenance Operations Protocol (MOP) for down-
line loading.

InfoServer operation across low-speed bridges is possible; however,
the underlying LASTport protocol assumes a low rate of packet loss.
Therefore, low-speed bridges may cause significant performance degra-
dation. For this reason, operation of the InfoServer is supported only
over 10 megabit bridges.

Features

Preinstallation of InfoServer Software with Simplified Updating

Customer or field service installation of InfoServer software on the
system is not required. The server boots when powered-on. For the Info-
Server 1000, the InfoServer software is in a FLASH ROM on the system
board. A simple server command is provided to update the InfoServer
software from CD-ROM, locally connected or connected to another Info-
Server on the same LAN.











                                 2

 

Network Updating

The InfoServer software allows system managers to update an InfoSer-
ver system from a compact disc mounted on another InfoServer system
on the LAN.

The InfoServer 1000 system FLASH ROM may also be updated by downline
loading of an appropriate image via MOP. This image is provided on the
InfoServer kernel distribution CD-ROM. The MOP server may be another
InfoServer (100, 150, 150VXT or 1000) or an OpenVMS system with an at-
tached CD-ROM drive in the same LAN.

All update operations (FUNCTIONS, MOP, SYSTEM, and VXT) are supported
using the BIND and UNBIND commands and the existing UPDATE commands.

Autoconfiguration (Automount)

The server autoconfigures devices based on the volume label and au-
tomatically creates service names for media present on the server. The
InfoServer recognizes the following formats (for both single and multi-
format CD-ROMs): ISO 9660, High Sierra, ULTRIX UFS, ODS-2, and Apple[R]
HFS.

Local and Remote Management Capability

The server can be managed by either a locally attached console (not
supplied) or a remote LAT terminal. Local and remote console capabil-
ities include configuration management, diagnostic information (built-
in self-test and diagnostic messages), and server control.

A local console is not required for the default mode of unattended op-
eration, but may be helpful in diagnosing hardware or software prob-
lems.

Password Protected Management Interface

A password-protected management interface allows control and monitor-
ing of server activity, with auto-prompting at any point in the com-
mand sequence, command-line recall, and built-in help.

Server Access Control

                                 3

 

Every InfoServer, and its corresponding set of clients, is a member
of a single LASTport group. A LASTport group is a mechanism used by
the InfoServer software to logically subdivide the InfoServer network.
Client systems and InfoServers must belong to the same LASTport group
for clients to access virtual disks on the InfoServer. Up to 1,024 LAST-
port groups can coexist in a single LAN.

Device Access Control

The number of connections allowed to a service or virtual disk can be
set. This can be used to manage the number of users allowed to access
a given application or data.

Multiple Read/Write Virtual Disks on a Single Physical Disk

The InfoServer can serve read/write disk partitions. A partition is
a logical subset of a read/write disk. A single disk can be subdivided
into several partitions, each of which can be served to the network
independently as a virtual disk. The access mode supports a single writer
or multiple readers, but not both concurrently (to prevent acciden-
tal corruption of data on the disk).

Read/Write Data Back-Up

Back-up operations can be performed locally via server commands or re-
motely using client-specific utilities.

InfoServer Tape Function for Remote Back-up

With the Tape Function Access option, customers can perform back-ups
via SCSI tape devices on the InfoServer.

Note: The InfoServer is not meant as an optimal performance controller
for all tape devices. Rather, use of the tape function with InfoSer-
ver is provided as a means of convenience for sharing a seldom-used
and costly device. Many factors, including network load, block size,
and additional load on the InfoServer contribute to the overall per-
formance characteristics of any given tape operation.


                                 4

 

One InfoServer client at a time can access an SCSI tape device. Once
the client has completed the task and disconnects from the device, it
becomes available to the other clients on the LAN. For supported de-
vices (see Device Support, Table 1), the InfoServer automatically ver-
ifies firmware revision levels of attached tape devices. InfoServer
software supports OpenVMS VAX version 5.4 and above and makes the tape
backup capabilities available to OpenVMS VAX users at a minimum of Ver-
sion 5.4. Users must install InfoServer VMS Client (QA-GGWAA-HX) for
tape functionality for OpenVMS version 5.4 through version 5.5-N.

CD/R Function Access

Using the InfoServer's CD/R function access, users can record or write
their own CDs from a DOS, OpenVMS, Windows NT [TM], or Digital UNIX
environment, using a native file format without any additional soft-
ware. When creating a CD, the data is actually staged on the InfoServer's
hard disk and then recorded locally to protect its integrity. Users
can also choose to use third party formatters to create ISO 9660 CDs
from those native environments.

The InfoServer 1000 CD/R functionality can be used for several appli-
cations including: the distribution of volumes of technical manuals,
updates of databases, replacement of microfiche, or near-term stor-
age of data.

A CD/R function access license and media/documentation kit are avail-
able to use with the InfoServer for compact disc mastering. Additional
requirements include: a CD/R device, an AV-compatible hard disk for
staging data (1 GB recommended), a CD reader, and formatter software
for converting files to the ISO 9660 standard, if ISO 9660 recording
is required.

File System Independence

InfoServer is a "virtual device" server. InfoServer does not impose
a file system on the virtual devices that it serves, instead the client
system interprets the on-disk structure. Multiple on-disk structures
can be served on a single InfoServer simultaneously. InfoServer is ca-
pable of automatically recognizing ODS-2, High Sierra, ISO 9660, UL-
TRIX UFS, and HFS (Apple) disk formats and creating service names which

                                 5

 

match the volume name. Other disk formats may be named manually through
the InfoServer management interface.

Automatic Failover to Duplicate Media

The LASTport protocol is designed to allow client systems to perform
automatic failover between duplicate media. Failover means that a user
connected to a service that becomes unavailable (such as a CD-ROM that
is removed from the system) is automatically connected to an identi-
cal service on the same or another InfoServer. If the service is not
found, the InfoServer client returns the appropriate message to the
user. The implementation of failover varies from client to client.

Load Balancing

InfoServer dynamically calculates a service rating for virtual disks
based upon load. These ratings are used by some client systems when
connections are requested. When the same disk is offered more than once
on the network, load balancing is provided. This includes the abil-
ity to load balance connections within a single InfoServer when du-
plicate virtual disks are present, as well as between multiple Info-
Servers with duplicate media on the network. Client systems select the
highest rated service.

Initial System Load

Some client systems implement Initial System Load (ISL) using a com-
bination of server-implemented, down-line load and virtual disk ca-
pabilities. This feature eliminates the need for locally attached soft-
ware distribution devices for initial system load on those client sys-
tems. ISL capabilities are supported for OpenVMS and VXT clients and
most, but not all, terminal servers.

ISO 9660 Support

The ability to recognize ISO 9660 formatted CD-ROM discs is provided
by OpenVMS VAX V6.0 and above and OpenVMS Alpha V1.0 and above. This
support only enables OpenVMS to recognize these formats and does not


                                 6

 

allow OpenVMS to run any executables built under other operating sys-
tems. ISO 9660 support can be obtained for OpenVMS VAX V5.5 and V5.5-
x as an add-on component through any Digital Customer Support Center.

Optional Functions Which Increase InfoServer Capabilities

The InfoServer software enables installation of InfoServer functional
upgrades from CD-ROMs. As new functions become available, customers
can purchase separately and install each function they wish to make
available on the LAN. For example, customers can add CD/R function-
ality to their previously installed base packaged systems by purchas-
ing the InfoServer CD Recordable Function Access license and media kit
(see OPTIONAL SOFTWARE section). They then can install the CD-ROM me-
dia on their InfoServer, which initializes the CD/R functionality.

SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS

The InfoServer system requires InfoServer client software for the fol-
lowing supported clients. Refer to client documentation for specific
client features.

OpenVMS Alpha and VAX Clients

InfoServer client support for disk services is included in the Open-
VMS VAX Operating System with version 5.4 and OpenVMS Alpha with ver-
sion 1.5. InfoServer client support for tape services is included in
