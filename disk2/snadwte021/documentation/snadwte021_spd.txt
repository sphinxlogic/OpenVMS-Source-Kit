          PRODUCT NAME:  Compaq DECwindows SNA 3270 Terminal     SPD 31.58.04
                         Emulator for OpenVMS, Version 2.1

          This SPD describes Compaq DECwindows SNA 3270 Terminal Emulator for
          OpenVMS, which is available for the OpenVMS Alpha and OpenVMS VAX plat-
          forms. All information applies to both platforms unless otherwise in-
          dicated.

          DESCRIPTION

          The Compaq DECwindows SNA 3270 Terminal Emulator for OpenVMS (DECwin-
          dows TE) is a software product that allows users of supported, Open-
          VMS based Compaq workstations and servers in a DECnet or TCP/IP net-
          work to access and use applications running on an IBM mainframe.

          The product runs in the DECwindows Motif[R] environment. Access to the
          IBM host-based applications system from OpenVMS systems is via one of
          the following SNA server or gateway products:

          TCP/IP or DECnet Connections

          o  Compaq SNA Peer Server

          o  Compaq SNA Domain Gateway

          o  Compaq SNA Access Server for Windows NT

          o  Compaq SNA Server for OpenVMS Alpha, an OpenVMS layered product that
             supports local access as well as remote DECnet clients

          DECnet Only Connections

          o  Compaq DECnet SNA Gateway for Synchronous Transport

          o  Compaq DECnet SNA Gateway for Channel Transport

          o  Compaq SNA Server for OpenVMS VAX, an OpenVMS VAX layered product
             that supports local access as well as remote DECnet clients

                                                                   April 2001

 



          Compaq DECwindows SNA 3270 Terminal                   SPD 31.58.04
          Emulator for OpenVMS, Version 2.1

          Communicating Between IBM and Compaq Systems

          In normal operation, IBM systems transfer a formatted screen much like
          a "form" or "panel" to the IBM 3270 block mode terminal. Terminal users
          fill in required data and the 3270 terminal transmits the completed
          form to the IBM host as a single unit. In contrast to this "block-mode"
          approach, Compaq terminals and workstations send data to OpenVMS host
          systems one character at a time. Using the DECwindows TE enables Com-
          paq's character-mode terminals to emulate IBM's block-mode style of
          computing by buffering outbound IBM data in the host system's memory
          before displaying it, as a single block, on the Compaq terminal. The
          Compaq terminal then transmits the screen form to the IBM host sys-
          tem via an SNA server or gateway.

          Translating ASCII and EBCDIC Data

          Compaq systems use ASCII code to represent data, while IBM systems use
          EBCDIC. DECwindows TE contains built-in translation tables that con-
          vert ISO Latin character input (given in ASCII code) to IBM multina-
          tional EBCDIC code for transfer through the SNA server or gateway. Users
          of DECwindows TE can modify these translation tables to fit most lan-
          guage needs.

          Starting the DECwindows TE

          Users can invoke the DECwindows TE from the OpenVMS command line or
          choose a custom menu selection on FileView or Session Manager.

          Users invoking DECwindows TE from an OpenVMS command line use the SNATERM
          command, along with DECwindows qualifiers to specify the IBM system
          and system resources to which they want to connect. While the DECwin-
          dows TE utility is running, its display window is formatted in the same
          style as a 3270 display station with the option of 3270, 3279-S3G, or
          3192-G terminal types. Exiting DECwindows TE returns control to the
          OpenVMS Operating System.

          These counts refer to the disk space required on the system disk. The
          sizes are approximate; actual sizes may vary depending on the user's
          system environment, configuration, and software options.

          Memory Requirements for DECwindows Support

          The minimum supported memory for this application running in a stand-
          alone DECwindows environment with both the client and server execut-
          ing on that same system is 4 MB.

          The performance and memory usage of DECwindows applications are par-
          ticularly sensitive to system configuration. Less memory may be re-
          quired on the client system (the system where the software is installed
          and executed) if the server (the component that displays the appli-
          cation) resides on another system. More memory may be required on a
          system with several applications running or may be desirable to im-
          prove the performance of an application.

          The minimum memory supported is 4 MB. However, additional memory im-
          proves performance. The memory size suggested for most typical hard-
          ware configurations is a minimum of 6 MB.
