 PRODUCT NAME:  DEC Distributed Queuing Service for     SPD 28.80.03
                OpenVMS, Version 1.3

 DESCRIPTION

 The standard OpenVMS queue system enables users to use the OpenVMS PRINT
 command to print files on output devices that are attached to the user's
 local OpenVMS node.

 The DEC Distributed Queuing Service (DQS) uses the DECnet networking
 system to extend the standard OpenVMS queue system to enable users to:

 o  Print jobs on printers connected to systems other than their own

 o  Show the status of jobs on those systems

 o  Cancel their jobs on those systems

 o  Change the specifications of their jobs on those systems

 Any node where a print request originates is called a client. Any node
 with an attached printer that performs the printing is called a server.
 Any node with DQS software can be configured to operate as only a client
 or as both a client and a server. The DQS software does not limit the
 number of client or server nodes or queues. The system manager cre-
 ates the queues and establishes the correspondence between client queues
 and queues on server nodes. A queue on a server node can accept jobs
 from queues on multiple client nodes.

 Features

 The following is a summary of features available in the DEC Distributed
 Queuing Service software:

 o  Provides an easy means of printing from systems that do not have
    printers.

                               DIGITAL                    April 1994

                                                         AE-KS63E-TE

 

 o  The DQS software can be used in any DECnet networking environment.
    Both Local Area Networks and Wide Area Networks are supported. DQS
    supports DECnet Phase V fullname functionality.

 o  The DQS software allows multiple OpenVMS systems to share expen-
    sive or unique printers.

 o  The DQS software does not limit the user's choice of printing equip-
    ment as it can work with standard Digital symbionts and most user-
    written or user-modified symbionts.

 o  Provides completely transparent support for the following quali-
    fiers of the OpenVMS PRINT command:

    /BACKUP     /BEFORE    /BURST
    /BY_OWNER   /CONFIRM   /CHARACTERISTICS
    /COPIES     /CREATED   /DEVICE
    /EXCLUDE    /EXPIRED   /FEED
    /FLAG                  /JOB_COUNT
                /IDENTIFY
    /LOWERCASE             /NAME
                /MODIFIED
    /NOTE       /QUEUE     /REMOTE
    /RESTART    /PAGES     /PASSALL
    /SETUP      /SINCE     /SPACE
    /TRAILER    /USER

    All other OpenVMS PRINT qualifiers are supported, with slight dif-
    ferences that reflect the distributed environment of DQS.

 o  If the DQS server is temporarily inaccessible when a print command
    is issued, the DQS client will attempt to transfer the job for print-
    ing after the DQS server again becomes available.

 o  If a printer becomes unavailable, the corresponding DQS server queue
    can be configured to direct print jobs to a different DQS server
    queue.

 o  The DQS software can send notification to the user after a print
    job has been completed.

                                  2

 

 o  Additional queues can be added and queue attributes changed with-
    out reinstalling the DQS software.

 o  Additional DQS nodes can be added to an existing network of DQS nodes
    without reinstalling the software on the existing nodes.

 o  The DQS software can be configured to limit access to servers.

 o  The DQS software can be configured to keep records of use.

 o  The DQS commands can be used on non-DQS queues.
