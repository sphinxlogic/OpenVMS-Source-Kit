PRODUCT NAME:  Compaq ACMS for OpenVMS, Version 4.4A   SPD 25.50.20
               (Application Control and Management Sys-
               tem)

DESCRIPTION

Compaq ACMS for OpenVMS (ACMS) is a transaction processing (TP) mon-
itor designed for the Compaq OpenVMS operating systems. ACMS works with
other Compaq Computer Corporation commercial application software prod-
ucts to provide users with a complete and customizable development and
run-time environment for transaction processing applications such as
order tracking, accounting and billing, banking, shop floor control,
and insurance claims processing.

ACMS software helps users through the entire application development
life cycle, including the installation, planning, design, development,
testing, implementation, management, and maintenance of complex TP ap-
plications. ACMS provides a special-purpose application definition lan-
guage for the structured definition of TP application functions and
run-time characteristics.

ACMS makes efficient use of the OpenVMS operating systems and asso-
ciated hardware resources, making ACMS particularly suited to mission-
critical applications that require high throughput and performance.

ACMS integrates with the following Compaq and third-party layered prod-
ucts:

o  Compaq TP Desktop Connector, formerly called ACMS Desktop, for mul-
   tivendor client access to ACMS applications

o  Compaq TP Web Connector for Web browser-based access to ACMS ap-
   plications

o  Compaq DECforms or Compaq TDMS for forms management (Note: Usage
   of TDMS requires an OpenVMS VAX system.)

                                                       January 2002

 

o  All OpenVMS languages that conform to the OpenVMS Calling Standard

o  Oracle CDD for the creation, analysis, and administration of meta-
   data

o  Oracle Rdb, Oracle CODASYL DBMS, and OpenVMS RMS for data manage-
   ment

o  Oracle Trace for performance event data collection

Because ACMS is designed to allow for modular implementation as well
as development, the client/server model can be used to separate and
distribute front-end processing (data input/output operations such as
forms processing) from back-end processing (data calculations and database
storage). In addition, ACMS allows users the use of nonstandard ter-
minal or I/O devices, such as bar-code readers and automatic teller
machines (ATMs).

ACMS provides the following features:

o  Application development environment

o  Run-time system

o  Application management and control

o  Remote system management

o  Client/server processing

o  Presentation services

o  Database management

o  Resource utilization collection and reporting

o  Task queuing

o  Data dictionary

                                 2

 

Application Development Environment

ACMS uses a high-level, English-like definition language that replaces
system service calls for most TP application functions. Using the ACMS
Application Definition Utility (ADU), a programmer can:

o  Structure all application work into three basic steps:

   -  Exchange steps for terminal I/O processing

   -  Processing steps for database access and general computation

   -  Block steps for performing work common to several processing and
      exchange steps

o  Control task execution and flow using conditional statements such
   as IF THEN ... ELSE, WHILE DO, SELECT FIRST, and CONTROL FIELD syn-
   tax in conjunction with Boolean expressions.

o  Define and implement subroutine transactions using the CALL TASK
   syntax.

o  Create menus and hierarchies of menus.

o  Define resources used to execute transactions, such as servers, workspaces,
   and audit trails.

o  Start and end database recovery units.

ACMS also includes the ACMS Task Debugger to debug ACMS definitions
and servers.

Run-Time System

ACMS includes a complete run-time system for application deployment.
The ACMS Run-Time System consists of eight specialized processes.

The following ACMS processes manage the work within ACMS transactions:

o  Command Process (CP) - Manages logins and interaction between ter-
   minals and ACMS. CPs are multithreaded (one CP process can handle
   menus and forms I/O for many ACMS terminals simultaneously). The
   CP passes input data to the Application Execution Controller (EXC)
   for processing by a server.

                                 3

 

o  Application Execution Controller (EXC) - Controls task execution
   for all the tasks in an application. Each application has its own
   EXC process, which starts up and controls the server processes needed
   to handle processing work for tasks.

o  Server Process (SP) - Carries out the high-level programming lan-
   guage routines or DCL routines that handle a task's processing work
   and database or file I/O. Programmers link their routines to the
   ACMS-supplied main program to create customized servers for database
   access, computation, and other functions.

o  Queued Task Initiator (QTI) - Removes task elements from a task queue
   and initiates their execution in a specified application. Queued
   tasks are tasks placed in a queue for later execution. Queued tasks
   cannot collect terminal input data; otherwise they are the same as
   any other ACMS task.

The ACMS processes that monitor and control the run-time system are:

o  ACMS Central Controller (ACC) - Acts as the central control point
   for ACMS run-time systems. The ACC starts and controls the Termi-
   nal Subsystem Controller, the QTI, the EXC, and the audit trail log.
   The ACC process must be started and running on each computer sys-
   tem where ACMS applications are used.

o  Audit Trail Logger (ATL) - Writes information about a running ACMS
   system to the audit trail log file. The ATL keeps a record of when
   the ACMS system starts and stops, when users log in, and when ap-
   plications and tasks start and stop.

o  Terminal Subsystem Controller (TSC) - Creates and controls the num-
   ber of active Command Processes (CPs) and assigns terminals to CPs.
   The TSC starts and stops CPs as needed, and controls which termi-
   nals can access ACMS.

o  Software Event Logger (SWL) - Records all ACMS internal software
   errors and event messages that occur during the execution of ACMS
   application programs.


                                 4

 

Communication among these run-time processes can occur on a single com-
puter system, or between more than one computer in a OpenVMS Cluster
system or DECnet network. For example, a Command Process (CP) on one
computer system can initiate a task within an application on another
computer system.

Application Management and Control

Once an application is developed, the user moves that application into
a production (real-use) environment. ACMS provides support for ACMS
applications used in a production environment.

ACMS includes seven utilities for defining, monitoring and modifying
application management characteristics:

o  ACMSGEN - Modifies and displays ACMS system parameters.

o  Application Authorization Utility (AAU) - Authorizes applications
   to be installed.

o  User Definition Utility (UDU) - Authorizes users to log in to ACMS
   and assigns login displays, including default menus, to ACMS users.

o  Device Definition Utility (DDU) - Authorizes ACMS terminals and,
   optionally, defines captive terminals to log in directly to ACMS.

o  Queue Manager (QUEMGR) - Creates and manages ACMS task queues and
   queued task elements.

o  Software Event Log Utility Program (SWLUP) - Creates reports of se-
   lected events recorded by the Software Event Logger.

o  Audit Trail Report Utility (ATR) - Returns records of application
   and user activity.

In addition to the utilities, ACMS also provides users with the fol-
lowing support for application management and control:

o  ACMS operator commands - Performs standard operator functions such
   as starting and stopping the ACMS system, the TSC process, the QTI
   process, and ACMS applications.

                                 5

 

o  Command procedures - Evaluates and modifies the values of OpenVMS
   and ACMS system parameters and of ACMS run-time process quotas.

Remote System Management

The ACMS Remote Manager provides the capability to monitor and man-
age the ACMS application environment. ACMS system managers can access
the Remote Manager using one of the supported interfaces over a TCP/IP
network.

The Remote Manager must be running on the same node as the ACMS run-
time system it is monitoring or accessing. Communication between the
Remote Manager and the ACMS run-time system is transparent.

Three interfaces allow access to the Remote Manager:

o  RPC Interface-Provides local or remote access to ACMS management
   information using the Open Network Computing Remote Procedure Call
   (ONC RPC) protocol. This interface can be used by user-written pro-
   grams to implement customized ACMS management tools.

o  Command Line Utility-Provides command line access to management in-
   formation as well as control of the Remote Manager process. This
   utility uses the RPC Interface.

o  Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) Interface-Provides net-
   work access to ACMS management information using the industry stan-
   dard SNMP protocol. This protocol is supported by most system man-
   agement consoles and tools.

ACMS system managers control the data being collected, including ACMS
process monitoring, and the management interfaces themselves through
either SNMP or RPC commands.

The Remote Manager enables ACMS system managers to do the following:

o  Remotely manage the Remote Manager.

o  Remotely manage data collection including configuring SNMP traps
   and viewing management information on line.

o  Remotely modify ACMS run-time systems.

                                 6

 

o  Write programs that remotely access management information online
   using ONC RPC and SNMP.

Client/Server Processing

ACMS uses the client/server model to distribute and separate functions.
This model can be implemented on a single node or on multiple nodes
in a DECnet network.

The terminal and menu functions are handled on the client, or front
end, of the transaction processing system, while task flow control,
data processing, and computations are performed on the server, or back
end, of the system.

Because the ACMS client/server model always provides separate front
and back ends, users can at any time offload the front-end to another
computer system without reprogramming the application code.

The ACMS Systems Interface (SI) lets users write front end programs,
or agents, to support specialized devices such as bar-code readers and
automatic teller machines.

ACMS includes support for failover in a distributed environment. If
one OpenVMS node is not available to process a transaction, ACMS can
automatically route the transaction to another application running on
an available node.

Presentation Services

ACMS supports both terminal-driven and PC/workstation-driven TP ap-
plications with presentation services. Users have the option of run-
ning ACMS tasks from menus on VT terminals, or from a GUI interface
on a PC/workstation desktop system.

ACMS supports DECforms as its primary presentation service for character-
cell terminals in ACMS applications. In addition, ACMS provides sup-
port for Compaq TDMS on OpenVMS VAX systems. ACMS applications that
use TDMS must be distributed in order to use ACMS on OpenVMS Alpha.
See the Compaq ACMS for OpenVMS Writing Applications manual for more
information about these restrictions.

                                 7

 

The TP Desktop Connector product provides an API that allows user-written
program running on various PC or workstation desktop systems to ini-
tiate and respond to ACMS tasks. A wide range of Compaq and third-party
desktop tools can be used for the development of client presentation
services and applications.

ACMS also provides support for other presentation service products through
the ACMS Request Interface and Systems Interface. The Request Inter-
face lets users use presentation services other than DECforms or TDMS
for I/O functions limited to one user per process. The Systems Inter-
face lets users use presentation services for single-user or multiple-
user I/O functions.

Database Management

ACMS includes support in its definition language for starting and end-
ing database transactions/recovery units through a database manage-
ment system. Database products supported include Oracle Rdb (includ-
ing SQL), RMS, and Oracle CODASYL DBMS.

Using the DECdtm component of the OpenVMS operating system, ACMS lets
users coordinate operations on multiple recoverable resources (such
as databases and files) within a single atomic transaction. Users can
perform operations on multiple databases through a single transaction
and ensure atomicity (that is, if the transaction fails, any changes
made to databases, files, or ACMS queues are rolled back to their pre-
vious state before the transaction started). Please note that RMS Jour-
naling for OpenVMS is required to support recoverable ACMS queue op-
erations coordinated using DECdtm. RMS Journaling for OpenVMS is a sep-
arate layered product, distinct from RMS, and is supplied with Open-
VMS.

ACMS applications can also access other data management products or
file management systems that support the OpenVMS Calling Standard.

Resource Utilization Collection and Reporting




                                 8

 

ACMS supports Oracle Trace to allow the collection and reporting of
event-based data gathered from any combination of OpenVMS layered prod-
ucts and ACMS applications. For each predefined event in ACMS, Ora-
cle Trace can collect information about resource utilization, such as
CPU time, or ACMS data items, such as task name. Using the Oracle Trace
cross-facility feature, you can relate ACMS events with events from
multiple layered products.

Task Queuing

Some ACMS applications require that the data be collected and stored
in a temporary storage area (queue) for the application to process at
another time. The ACMS queuing facility lets users create and manage
ACMS task queues. ACMS queue services are used to place/remove tasks
on/off ACMS task queues.

Data Dictionary

ACMS supports the Oracle CDD/Repository data dictionary. ACMS stores
application definitions in Oracle CDD/Repository directories and uses
Oracle CDD/Repository record definitions for its workspaces.

Security

ACMS ensures that the user's data remains secure by giving the sys-
tem manager control over which users have access to ACMS. Using Open-
VMS and ACMS authorization facilities, system managers can:

o  Authorize users to use ACMS.

o  Control terminals connecting to ACMS.

o  Limit the applications a user can run.

o  Prevent unauthorized access to the operating system while running
   ACMS tasks.

ACMS includes transaction security in the form of access control lists
(ACLs) in the definition language. Whenever a user selects a trans-
action, that user's OpenVMS identifier is checked against the ACL de-
fined for that transaction to determine whether that user is allowed
to execute that transaction.

                                 9

 

OpenVMS Cluster Environment/Availability

In a OpenVMS Cluster environment, ACMS applications support highly avail-
able configurations that help avoid single points of system failure.

ACMS includes support for failover in a OpenVMS Cluster environment.
If one OpenVMS Cluster processor is not available to process a trans-
action, ACMS can automatically route the transaction to another ap-
plication running on an available processor that shares the same data.

ACMS can improve the performance of a database management system in
a OpenVMS Cluster environment by allowing the use of the client/server
model to run database servers on a single processor.
