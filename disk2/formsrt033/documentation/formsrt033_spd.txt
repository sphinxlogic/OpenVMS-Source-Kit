PRODUCT NAME:  hp DECforms for OpenVMS, Version 3.3    SPD 29.90.12

DESCRIPTION

HP DECforms for OpenVMS (DECforms) is a software product for the de-
velopment and deployment of forms-based user interfaces for interac-
tive applications running on OpenVMS systems. DECforms is a complete
user interface management system (UIMS), providing applications with
not only the look and feel of a forms interface, but also a robust set
of dialog management and validation functions to control the user in-
terface at application execution time.

DECforms offers application programmers a set of form development tools
for creating forms-based user interfaces for the following end-user
environments:

o  VT-based character-cell terminals

o  Web browsers (in conjunction with the optional DECforms Web Con-
   nector product)

o  Motif workstations and X terminals

o  PostScript printers

Tools are also included for enabling application developers to upgrade
existing VT-based DECforms applications to take advantage of the more
powerful bitmap displays of Motif-based desktop devices.

DECforms embodies the following fundamental principles:

o  True separation of form and function

o  Efficient distribution of forms processing

o  Ease of use

                                                       January 2003

 

o  Flexibility of user interface control

o  Programming language independence

One of the most powerful principles reflected in the DECforms archi-
tecture is complete separation of form and function. User interface
processing is completely removed from the application program and to-
tally isolated within the form itself. In DECforms, a form is not sim-
ply a collection of fields and background text describing the form's
appearance. A DECforms form includes not just elements related to ap-
pearance, but also data and procedural elements that control the pro-
cessing of the user's interaction with the form. The application pro-
gram is only concerned with the processing of data, not with the gath-
ering and display of data at the user interface. This makes applica-
tion programs much simpler to develop and easier to maintain, and it
also allows a single application to support multiple end-user device
environments with user interfaces tailored to the capabilities of the
device and to the needs of the end-user. In other words, a single ap-
plication program can use DECforms to interact with users on character-
cell terminals, Motif devices, and Web browsers.

Forms comprise one or more panels that can be of any width and height
(for VTs, panels must be no larger than the size of the physical dis-
play device). If the data required to satisfy an application program's
request cannot be physically or aesthetically fit onto a single screen,
multiple panels can be defined within a single form to contain all the
necessary fields and background text. Thus, a form can be as large as
needed.

When panels are displayed on the screen, they are displayed in view-
ports (windows) that can be located any place on the screen. For VT
devices, DECforms provides a complete windowing system to manage these
viewports. For Motif-based devices or Web browsers, the services of
the associated windowing system are used-each viewport is associated
with a separate window. On VT devices, viewports are static-they can-
not be moved by the user. On Motif devices or Web browsers, the user
can move, resize, and minimize viewports as needed. DECforms automat-
ically displays and removes viewports with their associated panels to
gather and display all the data required by the application program.

                                 2

 

A form is described by the Independent Form Description Language (IFDL).
The IFDL, although primarily declarational, includes procedural con-
structs as well. Field level control, screen navigation, panel man-
agement, and cross field and relational validations are among the many
form processing activities that can be performed by the IFDL without
the need to return to the application program.

DECforms allows a single application to support multiple types of users
with interfaces tailored to their particular end-user environments,
where those environments are differentiated by such factors as desk-
top device and natural language. This tailoring is accomplished by uti-
lizing another DECforms structure called a layout. Sets of panels tai-
lored for a particular environment can be grouped together in a lay-
out. A form can consist of multiple layouts, each tailored for a dif-
ferent environment-for instance, one form can contain layouts for both
VT devices and Motif devices as well as layouts for English users, French
users, and German users. For simplicity, Web browsers use the VT lay-
outs. At run-time, DECforms chooses the one layout from within the form
appropriate for the end-user environment.

Features

The application program interacts with DECforms through a very sim-
ple, six-call record-level interface. Either single or multiple records
can be transferred in a single request.

All field-level processing is performed by the DECforms Run-Time Sys-
tem, not by the application program. The DECforms Run-Time System pro-
vides a wide variety of form, panel, and field-level control and pro-
cessing capabilities, including:

o  Multiline text fields

o  Simple arithmetic operations within the form

o  Scrolled regions with the following characteristics:

   -  Vertical or horizontal scrolling

   -  Containing one- or two-dimensional arrays

   -  Partial or full-line scrolling

                                 3

 

   -  Multiple lines per scrolled entry

o  Conditionally protecting, highlighting, and concealing fields

o  Changing video attributes dynamically based on real-time events

o  Highlighting fields when the cursor is present

o  Color support on VT241 and VT340 terminals via mapping to video at-
   tributes

o  Format validations:

   -  Character type

   -  Entry required

   -  Minimum length

   -  Full field

   -  No data input

o  Content validations:

   -  Range check

   -  List check

o  Context validations:

   -  Against a general expression

   -  Cross-field validations

o  Calling a user-defined routine (procedural escape routine) to per-
   form more complex validations, including file lookups

o  Built-in flexible field navigation capabilities on VTs allowing the
   operator to move among fields in any manner desired

o  Timeouts on field entries on character-cell terminals and Motif de-
   vices

o  Toggling between insert/overstrike mode on character-cell termi-
   nals and Motif devices

                                 4

 

For Motif devices, DECforms provides the following additional graph-
ical user interface (GUI) control and appearance capabilities:

o  Use of the mouse for random field navigation and other screen func-
   tions

o  Full font and color support

o  Push buttons

o  Slider fields (scale widget)

o  Horizontal and vertical scroll bars on data arrays, multiline text
   fields, and panels

o  Cut and paste text within fields, between fields, between panels,
   and between windows

o  Shadows and borders for 3D appearance

o  Open and closed polylines with different line styles

o  Grey scale fill patterns

For Web browsers, DECforms provides the following additional GUI con-
trol and appearance capabilities:

o  Selectable panel display style

o  Use of the mouse for random field navigation and other screen func-
   tions

o  Changeable background and foreground colors, screen size, font, and
   font size

o  Push buttons

o  Horizontal and vertical scroll bars on multiline text fields and
   panels

DECforms also provides an extremely flexible mechanism for defining
functions and redefining keyboards to suit the operator environment.
This includes support for multikey function definitions.

o  On Motif devices, chorded key functions are supported.

                                 5

 

o  On Web browsers, different default mappings are provided for those
   function keys not present on PC keyboards, typically F13-F20.

DECforms supports most OpenVMS data types, which means that data type
conversion does NOT have to be performed by the application program
in most cases.

DECforms can be used with HP DATATRIEVE to provide powerful, window-
like forms interfaces for queries and reports on data stored in RMS,
Oracle Rdb, and Oracle CODASYL DBMS files.

Internationalization Features

DECforms includes numerous internationalization features, allowing ap-
plications to support user interfaces in multilingual environments.
These features include:

o  Multiple natural language layouts per form

o  International date formats

o  Numeric data formatting, including replacing decimal point with comma

o  Multiple character currency signs

o  Multiple character sets

o  Flexible positioning of fields and literals to allow for transla-
   tion

o  OpenVMS Message Files to allow for translation

o  Integrated support for Hebrew language form development and pro-
   cessing, including right-to-left text path on character-cell ter-
   minals and Motif devices

Printing Support

Through the use of the printing layout, DECforms provides the capa-
bility for rendering high-quality, bitmap hardcopy forms for print-
ing on PostScript printers. The printing layout contains the speci-
fication of a user interface that is output only and specifies its out-
put device as a file, rather than a physical device. This file can serve

                                 6

 

as input to other DDIF-capable applications, for ultimate printing or
inclusion in compound documents.

Through the use of the printing layout, DECforms also supports the con-
cept of "batch printing" in which applications can use DECforms for
high-volume forms printing without the need for a physical display de-
vice.

Components

Form Manager

The Form Manager is the interface between an application program and
a display device. It is a run-time system that controls form display
and operator input on terminals. The Form Manager provides six requests
for communication between the form and the application. These requests
(routines in the Form Manager) allow the application to enable the form
for use, send data to the form, receive data from it (separately or
in one call), disable the form at the end of a session, or asynchronously
cancel a request.

The Form Manager is included with the DECforms Development System and
is also offered separately in the optional DECforms Run-Time System.
The only DECforms component available in this latter option is the Form
Manager. The Run-Time System allows the execution of applications us-
ing DECforms on a machine other than the one used to develop the ap-
plication.

The Server Wrapper Object (SWO) process is an extension to the run-
time capabilities of the Form Manager and is used in conjunction with
the DECforms Web Connector.

Form Development Environment (FDE)

The FDE allows a form designer to create a form interactively. The FDE
provides menus that help the designer step through various tasks of
form creation and modification. The FDE is used with either the VT-
based Panel Editor or the Motif-based Panel Editor to create the ap-
pearance of the form. The FDE also provides access to text editors,
including the Language Sensitive Editor (LSE), part of HP DECset for

                                 7

 

OpenVMS Systems, to allow a designer to write statements in the Independent
Form Description Language (IFDL) that describes a DECforms form.

Independent Form Description Language (IFDL)

The IFDL is a semi-procedural language that completely describes a DECforms
form. It allows the form designer to create a form (noninteractively),
specifying its appearance and functions. While the appearance of a form
can be entirely created by the panel editors, procedural aspects of
the form, such as specialized responses to function keys and special-
ized data validation, must be specified directly with IFDL statements.
An IFDL source file is a text file that can be created or modified with
any text editor.

LSE templates are available for the IFDL language to aid in the cre-
ation and maintenance of IFDL source code. DECforms also supports the
Compile and Review capabilities of the LSE.

The IFDL also includes a COPY statement that provides for the copy-
ing of record and field definitions from the Oracle CDD/Repository.
DECforms supports Oracle CDD/Repository pieces tracking by deposit-
ing information in the dictionary indicating that a particular form
has used a certain record. DECforms can also use Oracle CDD/Repository
records defined with the BASED ON attribute and those referenced through
RDB$RELATIONS.

IFDL Translator

The IFDL translator compiles an IFDL source file into a binary form
file. This form file is then ready for use with its application. Its
appearance can be tested on a terminal screen or printed. The binary
form file may be analyzed by other DECforms utilities, or edited in
the FDE or the appropriate panel editor.

Back Translator

The Back Translator converts a binary form file into an IFDL source
file. Essentially, it performs the reverse function of the IFDL Trans-
lator. As a result, it provides a method of editing the IFDL source
for a form created or modified by the FDE or panel editor. The IFDL

                                 8

 

source statements that the Back Translator produces also provide a com-
plete textual description of the form.

Panel Editors

The VT-based Panel Editor and the Motif-based Panel Editor allow the
user to create graphic form elements in an interactive, "What You See
Is What You Get" (WYSIWYG) fashion. The panel editors support the in-
teractive creation of the visual elements of a form's panels: back-
ground text and graphics, and the locations, sizes and attributes of
fields.

VT-to-Pixel Layout Converter

The VT-to-Pixel Layout Converter takes as input a DECforms binary .FORM
file containing a character-cell layout and produces as output an .IFDL
source file containing a pixel layout in addition to the original character-
cell layout. The new layout is a "first-pass" pixel layout that re-
quires some additional manual modifications to effectively take ad-
vantage of the additional characteristics of the pixel device, such
as the use of the mouse and the full range of fonts and colors.

Extract Utility

The Extract Utility performs three functions:

o  Produces a printable representation of a form's panels from a form
   file.

o  Creates object modules containing a form. These object modules can
   then be linked in an executable image with a program as a memory-
   resident form for use by the same program in a single session or
   in multiple sessions. The modules can also be linked in shareable
   images for use by multiple sessions from multiple processes.

o  Produces an object module that contains pointers, or vectors, to
   procedural escape routines named in the form file. Escape routines
   are calls from the form to user-supplied subroutines created to do
   additional processing outside the form.

Test Utility

                                 9

 

The Test Utility allows certain aspects of the form to be tested sep-
arately from its application program. It allows a form designer to check
the appearance of a form's panels without having to first write a pro-
gram.

Sample Applications and Demonstration Forms

The sample applications show how a form and an application program can
interact. One of the samples includes a simple form with a few pan-
els and a simple application program that makes requests of the form
through the Form Manager. This introductory sample application is avail-
able only in FORTRAN and C.

The more complex sample application includes a form with many panels
and many responses to various events, as well as an application pro-
gram that makes several requests of the form. This application is avail-
able in Ada, BASIC, C, COBOL, DIBOL, FORTRAN, Pascal, and PL/I.

In addition to the sample applications, the DECforms development kit
contains a package of demonstration forms, their sources, and a demon-
stration guide illustrating a number of key features of DECforms.

FMS Converter

The FMS Converter is a migration tool that converts forms or form li-
braries created with HP FMS for OpenVMS (Forms Management System) into
a DECforms IFDL source file. This process converts the appearance of
the FMS forms into a similar appearance described by the DECforms IFDL.
The converter does NOT convert the application program or the User Ac-
tion Routines (UAR) associated with the FMS forms. The FMS Converter
works with forms created with FMS V2.0 or later.

TDMS Converter (available on OpenVMS VAX only)

A TDMS Converter is available from Praxa Limited. This tool converts
forms and request definitions created with Compaq TDMS for OpenVMS VAX
(Terminal Data Management System) into DECforms IFDL. The tool also
includes a COBOL translator for converting TDMS calls in a COBOL ap-
plication program to equivalent DECforms calls. For more information,
contact TDMS@praxa.com.au.

Developing Forms for IBM 3270 Terminals

A special version of DECforms V1.4, shipped exclusively as part of the
HP SNA 3270 Application Services software, allows remote SNA-networked
IBM 3270 terminal and PC users to access forms-oriented VAX and Alpha
applications. This special version of DECforms provides users with ad-
ditional features in the OpenVMS VAX development tools to develop and
maintain forms for display on 3270 class devices and Run-Time Systems
on both OpenVMS VAX and OpenVMS Alpha that can generate and interpret
a 3270 data stream. This version of DECforms is not available as a stan-
dalone product and can only be used in conjunction with HP SNA 3270
Application Services software and the HP SNA Domain Gateway. The me-
dia and documentation for this version of DECforms are available as
part of the HP SNA 3270 Application Services product; however, a stan-
dard DECforms development license is required to use this version. Re-

1. DECforms also supports the Hebrew versions of the VT100, VT200, and
   VT300 series terminals.

2. The VT131 is supported in VT102 mode only.

3. DECforms does not support the use of the 25th status line nor the
   use of the locator device on VT300-series terminals.

4. DECforms panels of up to 72 lines may be defined for VT420 and VT500
   series terminals. These terminals can display 24, 36, or 48 lines
   on a single screen. Panels consisting of a number of lines greater
   than the screen size can be panned under local hardware control by
   the terminal. DECforms does not support access to the F1-F5 func-
   tion keys or to the ALTERNATE key. The COMPOSE key is supported when
   configured for LOCAL COMPOSE.



                                12

 

5. DECforms supports display of forms on directly connected IBM 3270-
   class terminals only when those terminals are connected to the CXM04
   3270 Terminal Option Card of a DECserver 550. This option card makes
   the IBM 3270-compatible device appear as a VT220 to the applica-
   tion.

Terminal Emulators

Terminal emulators on workstations and personal computers are supported
only to the extent that the emulator conforms to the environment it
is emulating.

Printers

DECforms printing layouts can be converted to PostScript files that
can then be printed on any device compatible for printing PostScript
files.

DECforms character-cell panels and forms can be printed on any printer.
Video attributes are not printed and lines are drawn using the char-
acters "-", "+", " " rather than the line-drawing character set.

Disk Space Requirements (Block Cluster Size = 1)

These counts refer to the disk space required on the system disk. The
sizes are approximate; actual sizes may vary depending on the user's
system environment, configuration, and software options.

Memory Requirements for DECwindows Motif

The minimum supported memory for this application running in a stan-
dalone DECwindows Motif environment with both the client and the server
executing on the same system is 16MB.

The performance and memory usage of DECwindows Motif applications are
particularly sensitive to system configuration. Less memory may be re-
quired on the client system (the system where the software is installed
and executed) if the server (the component that displays the appli-
cation) resides on another system. More memory may be required on a
system with several applications running, or may be desirable to im-
prove the performance of an application.
