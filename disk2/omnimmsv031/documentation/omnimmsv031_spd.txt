PRODUCT NAME:   Compaq OMNI MMS                        SPD 47.89.07
                 Version 3.1

DESCRIPTION

Compaq OMNI MMS is a network communication product that provides a so-
lution for the connection and management of manufacturing/utility con-
trol devices and systems. Compaq OMNI MMS implements the Manufactur-
ing Message Specification (MMS), ISO/IEC 9506-1 and ISO/IEC 9506-2.
When combined with prerequisite hardware and software, Compaq OMNI MMS
interoperates with other systems supporting the Manufacturing Message
Specification ISO/IEC9506-1 and ISO/IEC 9506-2 specifications.

Features

Compaq OMNI MMS is an implementation of the Manufacturing Message Spec-
ification (MMS), ISO/IEC 9506. It relies upon the Compaq OMNI API prod-
uct that provides a high level applications programming interface (API)
with a high degree of functionality built in. The interface is easy
to use and requires very little support code. For more information,
please refer to the Compaq OMNI API Software Product Description (SPD
47.88.xx).

Alternatively, Compaq OMNI MMS can be integrated with the BASEstar Open
Server product (SPD 47.87.xx) for connection to plant devices which
use the MMS protocol.

Compaq OMNI MMS provides, as a minimal set, the Client Conformance re-
quirements for the services specified in MAP Implementation Class MAP3.

The product is able to connect to those devices that have implemented
to ISO/IEC 9506 (MMS).

   ware and documentation are available

o  Verification of the appropriate system parameters

o  Verification that the system meets the minimum hardware and soft-
   ware requirements as specified in this SPD

o  Installation of the Compaq OMNI MMS software by creating the nec-
   essary directories and by copying the software from the distribu-
   tion media

o  Verification that Compaq OMNI MMS has been installed correctly by
   using the IVP

Compaq OMNI MMS Installation Verification Procedure (IVP)

The Compaq OMNI MMS IVP performs a series of tests to verify proper
installation.

Note 4:

Read and Write indications are delivered to user written code and thus
uninterruptible access is application dependent.

Note 5:

The syntax and semantics for file name are specified by the OpenVMS
operating system. This is documented in the OpenVMS documentation un-
der "Full File Specification". Wildcard specifiers are not permitted.

The file name must be specified in the first graphic string of the File-
Name production. Any information in additional graphic strings will
be ignored.

Note 6:

The range is 1-infinity. Acceptance of indications is under program-
ming control. The actual number of outstanding requests allowable is
dependent upon process memory limits which is set by either the pro-
grammer or system manager.

Note 7:

This implementation does not specify additional code nor additional
detail in error type.

Note 8:

The following semantics are defined for the use of the local detail
calling/called fields. As a result, a limit is set for a maximum MMS
PDU size, which limits specific functions.

The semantics of this field are contained in the implementation agree-
ments of the NIST (National Institute for Standards and Technology -
OSE Implementor's Workshop) Special Publication 500-214 titled Sta-
ble Implementation Agreements for Open Systems Interconnection Pro-
tocols, Version 7, Edition 1, December 1993, Part 20 (MMS) Sections
8.2.0.3 and 8.2.0.4.
