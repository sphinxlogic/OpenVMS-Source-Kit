 PRODUCT NAME:  Data Cartridge Server Component for OpenVMS, Version 3.2
 SPD 33.59.05

 DESCRIPTION

 The Data Cartridge Server Component (DCSC) for OpenVMS software pro-
 vides control path access for OpenVMS VAX[TM] and OpenVMS Alpha[TM]
 system users to tape cartridges located in a StorageTek[R] Automated
 Cartridge System (ACS) Library. DCSC can be installed on either a sin-
 gle OpenVMS system or a VMScluster.

 DCSC provides control path access by establishing communications with
 the StorageTek[R] UNIX[R] server and software that controls the re-
 sources within an ACS Library. The StorageTek[R] server software is
 known as Automated Cartridge System Library Software (ACSLS). DCSC can
 be configured to communicate with up to sixteen StorageTek[R] library
 servers.

 DCSC manages the library resources within an OpenVMS system. This in-
 cludes managing the allocation of ACS transports, locking and unlock-
 ing both cartridge and transport resources to accommodate user tape
 function requests, and recovering any unused resources (caused by a
 user mounting a tape and logging out before dismounting it).

 When a user requests a tape function such as mount, DCSC checks for
 the existence of the requested cartridge, selects an available trans-
 port, and locks the required resources. DCSC ensures the tape cartridge
 is physically loaded onto a StorageTek[R] transport and, if requested,
 executes an OpenVMS tape mount function.

 On a VMScluster consisting of several nodes, DCSC must be installed
 on each node requiring access to the StorageTek[R] library server. DCSC
 on one node must be configured as the Master server. The DCSC Master
 server fields requests from the other nodes on the VMScluster, which
 are called DCSC Virtual server nodes. Communication between DCSC Mas-
 ter and Virtual server nodes is via DECnet. Communication between the
 DCSC Master server node and the StorageTek[R] library server is via
 Compaq TCP/IP Services for OpenVMS.

 DCSC provides a variety of sample programs and a sample tape manage-
 ment system. These are provided for demonstration purposes only. Com-
 paq recommends the use of Compaq's Archive/Backup System or Storage
 Library System tape automated backup solutions.

 The DCSC kit includes the following:

 o  DCSC Run-Time Library (RTL) routines-A set of tools that let pro-
    grammers design applications specific to their system and users.

 o  DCSC DCL Interface - lets users request tape cartridge functions
    (to request a mount of a specific tape cartridge, for example) from
    the OpenVMS DCL interface.

 o  Configuration File Editor - A menu-driven interface that lets sys-
    tem managers create the configuration file used to describe the trans-
    port and ACS environment to DCSC. DCSC reads this file when it starts
    up and uses it to determine operation, network, and transport re-
    source allocations.

 o  DCSC Server-A set of processes that manage user requests by allo-
    cating transport resources to users on an OpenVMS system.

 The following documentation is available:

 o  Data Cartridge Server Component Installation Guide - Explains how
    to install the DCSC and provides a sample installation log file.

 o  Data Cartridge Server Component System Manager's Guide - Describes
    the DCSC, how it works with the robotic tape library, configura-
    tion tasks, how to use the Configuration File Editor system, and
    DCSC-specific system maintenance tasks.

 o  Data Cartridge Server Component Programmer's Reference Guide - De-
    scribes the DCSC RTL routines and describes how to use them by pro-
    viding examples of C code fragments.

 o  Data Cartridge Server Component User's Reference Guide - Summarizes
    the main functions of the DCSC, highlighting the functions performed
    by general users, such as mounting and dismounting tapes. In ad-
    dition, it describes how to use the DCSC cartridge DCL commands.

 INSTALLATION

 Compaq recommends that a customer's first purchase of this software
 product include DCSC Startup Services. These services provide for in-
 stallation and configuration of the software product by an experienced
 Compaq Software Specialist.

 For subsequent purchases of this product only experienced customers
 should attempt installation. Compaq recommends that all other customers
 purchase DCSC Startup Services.

 HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS

 System Requirement:

 o  OpenVMS systems that can achieve data path connectivity to Stor-
    ageTek[R] ACS SCSI tape transports through an OpenVMS supported SCSI
    interface.

 o  Legacy OpenVMS systems with data path connectivity to StorageTek[R]
    ACS FIPS tape transports through TC44-AA, TC44-BA, or KCM44 con-
    trollers.

 Processors Supported:

 DCSC runs on VAX[TM] and Alpha[TM] processors supported by OpenVMS.
 For a detailed list of Processors supported by OpenVMS, refer to the
 OpenVMS System Software Product Description. (SPD 25.01) Processor Re-
 strictions:

 The processor used must be sufficiently capable of handling both the
 installation and daily operations of the Data Cartridge Server Com-
 ponent (DCSC), the Compaq TCP/IP Services for OpenVMS product, and any
 customized applications software.

 A CD-ROM reader is required for DCSC installation.

 An Ethernet connection is required for each processor that uses the
 DCSC. That processor must support the Ethernet boards supported by Com-
 paq TCP/IP Services for OpenVMS (V2.0 thru V5.0)

 Other Hardware Required:

 DCSC requires a terminal such as a VT220, VT240, VT320, or VT340 or
 any equivalent terminal emulation package.

 DCSC also requires a StorageTek[R] Automated Cartridge System, includ-
 ing tape drives and associated software.

 DCSC has been tested with the StorageTek[R] 4400/4410 ACS, Powderhorn
 9310, and WolfCreek 9360 libraries. DCSC is also compatible with the
 StorageTek[R] TimberWolf 9740, 9730, and 9710 libraries when they are
 controlled via Automated Cartridge System Software (ACSLS). DCSC nei-
 ther provides nor guarantees data path access to StorageTek[R] tape
 drives. Drive types (e.g. Ultra-SCSI; 36-track, read 18-track; helical-
 scan; DLT) must be compatible with and qualified for the designated
 OpenVMS operating system, processor and hardware controller.

 Disk Requirements (Block Cluster Size = 1):

 The following counts refer to the disk space required on the VAX[TM]
 system disk. Notice that the sizes listed are approximate; actual sizes
 may vary depending on your system environment, configuration, and soft-
 ware options.

 Disk space required for    8,000 blocks
 installation:
                            (4.1 Mbytes)



                                  4

 Disk space required for    7,500 blocks
 use (permanent):
                            (3.8 Mbytes)

 The following counts refer to the disk space required on the Alpha[TM]
 system disk. Notice that the sizes listed are approximate; actual sizes
 may vary depending on your system environment, configuration, and soft-
 ware options.

 Disk space required for    15,000 blocks
 installation:
                            (7.7 Mbytes)

 Disk space required for    14,000 blocks
 use (permanent):
                            (7.2 Mbytes)

 The minimum memory supported is 32 Mbytes. However, increasing the mem-
 ory capability improves the performance of this software. The memory
 size suggested for most typical hardware configurations is at least
 32 Mbytes.
