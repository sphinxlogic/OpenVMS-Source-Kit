PRODUCT NAME:  DIGITAL GKS Version 6.5 for OpenVMS VAX SPD 26.20.19

DESCRIPTION

DIGITAL GKS (Graphical Kernel System) (formerly DEC GKS) for OpenVMS VAX
Systems is a two-dimensional and three-dimensional graphics support
system that provides a set of programming functions for creating in-
teractive and noninteractive graphics applications. As a development
tool, DIGITAL GKS is a solid base for portable, device-independent ap-
plications that define and display graphical images, using a variety
of graphics devices.

DIGITAL GKS for OpenVMS VAX is Digital Equipment Corporation's imple-
mentation of the 1988 ISO 8805 standard GKS for Three Dimensions (GKS-3D)
and the ISO 7942 standard GKS. DIGITAL GKS conforms to level 2c of this
standard, providing full output capabilities, including workstation-
independent segment storage (level 2), and full synchronous and asyn-
chronous input capabilities (level c).

DIGITAL GKS is the merger of two earlier products:

o  DEC GKS-3D Version 1.2, a three-dimensional product

o  DEC GKS Version 4.2, a two-dimensional product

The resulting product provides both two-dimensional and three-dimensional
capabilities in a single package, and was first made available as DEC GKS
Version 5.0.

DIGITAL GKS supports DECwindows and DECwindows Motif for OpenVMS VAX
or OpenVMS VAX Workstation Software (VWS), and is supported on most
DIGITAL processors running the OpenVMS VAX Operating System.

                                                         April 1997

                                                        AE-BP36U-TE

 

DIGITAL GKS is device-independent; the same program can generate graph-
ical output on different devices without modification to the source
code. The graphical output formats supported by DIGITAL GKS include:

o  CGM (Computer Graphics Metafile)

o  DDIF (DIGITAL Document Interchange Format)

o  Hewlett-Packard Graphics Language (HP-GL)

o  Hewlett-Packard Printer Control Language (HP PCL)

o  PostScript

DIGITAL GKS provides four language bindings in which graphical data
can be created and managed. These bindings are: C, ISO FORTRAN, GKS$
(a two-dimensional, language-independent binding), and
GKS3D$ (a three-dimensional, language-independent binding).

DIGITAL GKS is a subroutine library packaged as a set of shareable im-
ages with which application programs are linked. The shareable images
are activated at run-time as needed.

PEX Support

DIGITAL GKS supports output to the DIGITAL implementation of PEX Ver-
sion 5.0 and PEX Version 5.1 servers. For OpenVMS VAX, the PEX server
extension and the PEXlib object library are included in the DIGITAL GKS
kit.

Output Modes

With DIGITAL GKS, you can describe a graphical object using either seg-
ments or immediate mode. A segment is a set of output primitives that
are created, manipulated, and deleted as a group, but are not modi-
fiable. DIGITAL GKS manages segments internally and automatically re-
draws them if the display is damaged (for example, if the display win-
dow is obscured and then exposed).


                                 2

 

In immediate mode, primitives are rendered directly to the display sur-
face without being stored internally in DIGITAL GKS. This mode is use-
ful when graphical data is temporary, or will be refreshed by the ap-
plication.

Output Primitives

DIGITAL GKS provides a variety of output primitives for creating ba-
sic two-dimensional and three-dimensional graphics. These primitives
are:

Cell Array    A rectangular image specified by a two-dimensional
              array of rectangular color cells on a plane arbi-
              trarily placed in three-dimensional space.

Fill Area     A polygonal area that can be hollow or filled with
              a uniform color, a pattern, or a hatch style. The
              edges of the area are not defined and cannot be
              controlled.

Fill Area     A set of polygonal areas with holes or disjointed
Set           regions that are treated as a single entity. These
              areas can be hollow or filled with a uniform color,
              patterns, or hatch styles. Control of edge at-
              tributes is provided.

Generalized   A primitive providing access to drawing capabilities
Drawing       of graphics devices not used by the other primitives
Primitive     listed here; circles and arcs are two common GDPs.
(GDP)

Polyline      A set of connected lines defined by a series of
              points and having line type, line width, and color
              attributes defined.






                                 3

 


Polymarker    One or more symbols that can mark significant points
              in a display and have type, size, scale, and color
              attributes defined.

Text          A character string at a given position in world
              coordinates. This string can be in 8-bit or 16-
              bit format, and can be displayed in a variety of
              fonts, orientations, sizes, and colors. Text size is
              affected by transformations.

Attributes

Each output primitive has an associated set of attributes that con-
trol the primitive's appearance. Attributes can be defined in groups
(bundles) or individually. Some examples of attributes are:

Line Type    The style of a line, for example, dotted or dashed.

Line         The width of the line.
Width

Color        The color of a primitive. You can select one of the
             predefined colors or specify the red, green, and blue
             intensities required to define a particular color on
             color devices.

Character    Text attributes, including font, character spacing,
Attributes   height, angle, path, and alignment.

Viewing Operations

DIGITAL GKS allows you to specify views of three-dimensional objects
and define the "working" or world coordinate system used in these views.
World coordinates can have any scale. For example, one application might
have a maximum range from 0 to 1000.0; another application might limit
the range from 0.01 to 0.1.



                                 4

 

You can control multiple, simultaneous views of the same objects on
one or more display surfaces, as well as the position and size of the
image on the surface. For example, one application program can dis-
play an image of a cube in one window on a workstation, and at the same
time, the program can display a detail of the back of the cube in an-
other window (on another workstation, if required).

Control Functions

Control functions are used to perform system management tasks related
to the DIGITAL GKS environment, the workstation environment, and the
graphics display. These tasks include turning DIGITAL GKS on and off
when requested by the application, directing the flow of graphics data
to logical output devices and managing the picture process.

Inquiry Functions

DIGITAL GKS includes a complete set of inquiry functions. These func-
tions are used to obtain information about the DIGITAL GKS state, seg-
ment storage, workstation capabilities, or the workstation state. This
information is essential for developing modular, device-independent
programs.

Escape Functions

Escape functions are included with DIGITAL GKS to enable access to func-
tionality not provided in the GKS standard. The DIGITAL GKS escape func-
tions include:

o  Double buffering control

o  Background pixmap control

o  Screen dumps

Logical Input Devices

DIGITAL GKS supports synchronous and asynchronous input from the fol-
lowing logical input devices:

Locator  Allows the user to select a point on the display.

Stroke   Allows the user to input a series of points on the dis-
         play.

Valuator Allows the user to select a real number from a range of
         numbers, for example, by sliding a pointer to a position
         on a radio dial.

Choice   Allows the user to make a selection, for example, from a
         list of choices in a menu.

String   Allows the user to input a character string, for example,
         as input to a prompt.

Pick     Allows the user to select an object that is visible on
         the display. The information returned consists of a seg-
         ment name, a pick identifier, and the segment status.
         Primitives outside segments cannot be picked.

Character Fonts and Sets

DIGITAL GKS includes a series of stroke-precision character fonts. These
character fonts were digitized by Dr. Allen V. Hershey of the Naval
Surface Weapons Laboratory, and supplied to DIGITAL by the National
Bureau of Standards.

DIGITAL GKS also provides text support for the native character sets
of the supported graphical devices.

Language Bindings

DIGITAL GKS functions can be accessed by four sets of subroutine calls
or "bindings," as they are referred to by the GKS standards. These bind-
ings are:

o  A FORTRAN binding that conforms to the ISO (DIS 8806/1) FORTRAN bind-
   ing to GKS-3D.

                                 6

 

o  A C binding that conforms to a three-dimensional extension of the
   ISO (DP 8651/4) C language binding to GKS.

o  GKS3D$, a language-independent, three-dimensional binding that fol-
   lows the standard calling conventions and is callable by many dif-
   ferent languages.

o  GKS$, a language-independent, two-dimensional binding that follows
   the standard calling conventions and is callable by many differ-
   ent languages.

GKS-3D Metafile

DIGITAL GKS provides the capability of reading and writing sequential
files in two formats: the ISO 8805 suggested GKS-3D Metafile format
and the ISO 7942 suggested two-dimensional GKSM Metafile format. The
metafiles can be used to:

o  Save and restore graphical information between sessions in a device-
   independent format

o  Transfer graphical information between systems with compatible ver-
   sions of DIGITAL GKS

o  Transfer graphical information between two DIGITAL GKS applications

o  Transfer graphical information from a DEC GKS-3D application to a
   DIGITAL GKS application

o  Store accompanying nongraphical information

DIGITAL Document Interchange Format (DDIF) Output

DIGITAL GKS provides support for storing two-dimensional views of three-
dimensional objects encoded in DIGITAL Document Interchange Format (DDIF).
Views stored in DDIF can be processed by applications that conform to
the DIGITAL Compound Document Architecture (CDA).



                                 7

 

Computer Graphics Metafile (CGM) Output

DIGITAL GKS provides support for storing information using the Computer
Graphics Metafile (CGM), an approved ANSI standard format (ANSI X3.122-
1986). DIGITAL GKS supports CGM output for the following formats:

o  Clear Text Encoding - Graphical output data stored in this format
   is easily created, viewed, and modified using a common text edi-
   tor. This format is also suitable for transferring graphical out-
   put data through networks that support the transfer of text files
   only.

o  Character Encoding - Graphical output data is typically stored in
   this format to reduce the file size. This format is especially suited
   to transfers through networks that do not support binary transfers.

o  Binary Encoding - Graphical output data stored in this format is
   very compact and the fastest to read and write. This format is the
   least suitable for transmission over communication lines because
   all 8 bits in each byte are meaningful.

Graphics Handlers

DIGITAL GKS includes support for a wide variety of graphics devices
provided by DIGITAL and other vendors. For devices that are not sup-
ported by DIGITAL, users can develop their own graphics device han-
dlers using the DIGITAL GKS device handler interface.

Device handlers can be developed in VAX FORTRAN, DEC Fortran, VAX C,
and DEC C. For more information on this interface, refer to the Build-
ing a Device Handler System for DEC GKS and DEC PHIGS manual (Order
No. QA-810AK-GZ), which can be purchased separately.

Disk Space Requirements

The disk space requirements for DIGITAL GKS depend on the kit you in-
stall, as shown.

DIGITAL GKS Development Kit:

Disk space required for      49,000 blocks
installation:

Disk space required for      48,000 blocks
use (permanent):

DIGITAL GKS Run-Time-Only Kit:

Disk space required for      28,000 blocks
installation:



                                11

 


Disk space required for      27,000 blocks
use (permanent):

These counts refer to the disk space required on the system disk. The
sizes are approximate; actual sizes may vary depending on the user's
system environment, configuration, and software options.

Memory Requirements for DECwindows and DECwindows Motif Support

The minimum supported memory for DIGITAL GKS running in a standalone
DECwindows and DECwindows Motif environment, with both the client and
server executing on the same system, is 32 MB. The memory size sug-
gested for most typical hardware configurations, however, is 64 MB or
more, depending on the system.

The system configuration and performance requirements of DECwindows
and DECwindows Motif applications can determine the memory needed on
your system as follows:

o  Less memory may be required on the client system (where the soft-
   ware is installed and executed) if the server (component display-
   ing the application) resides on another system.

o  More memory may be required on a system where improved performance
   is desired, or where several applications are running.

applications that were developed on a system where the full DIGITAL GKS
product was installed. As a result, the Run-Time-Only Kit license is
available at a substantially lower cost per system than the Develop-
ment Kit license.

License Management Facility Support

DIGITAL GKS supports the OpenVMS VAX License Management Facility (LMF).
This facility allocates license units for DIGITAL GKS as follows:

o  For the Development option-on a Personal Use and Unlimited Use basis

o  For the Run-Time-Only option-on a Concurrent Use and Unlimited Use
   basis

Each Personal Use License allows one identified individual to use DIGITAL GKS.
Each Concurrent Use License allows only one individual at a time to
use DIGITAL GKS. Each Unlimited Use License allows any number of in-
dividuals to use DIGITAL GKS at the same time.
