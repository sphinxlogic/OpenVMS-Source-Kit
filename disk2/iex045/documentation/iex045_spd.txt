PRODUCT NAME:  IEX-VMS-DRIVER, Version 4.5             SPD 26.30.11

DESCRIPTION

The DIGITAL IEX-VMS-DRIVER allows programs written in VAX MACRO and
higher-level languages (such as VAX FORTRAN, VAX BASIC, and VAX Pascal)
to communicate through the IEU11-A or IEQ11-A with devices contain-
ing an IEC 625-1 or IEEE-488 Standard interface. This communication
is implemented through a choice of direct QIO calls or a set of sub-
routines callable from high-level languages.

Note: In the following description, the term IEX11 stands for the IEU11-
A and/or IEQ11-A interface. The IEU11-A supports VAX UNIBUS machines,
and the IEQ11-A supports MicroVAX Q-bus machines.

The IEX11-A interface is a bit-parallel, byte-serial device that can
perform transfers in either program interrupt or DMA (direct memory
access) mode. Program interrupt is used for transferring commands and
addresses, while DMA is used for transferring data. DMA significantly
reduces processor loading during the transfer of long data buffers.

The IEX11-A interface contains two independent IEC/IEEE bus controllers,
also known as General Purpose Interface Buses (GPIBs). These two con-
trollers may be connected to the same or to different IEC/IEEE buses.
Up to 15 devices may be attached to each IEC/IEEE bus. Each IEX11-A
IEC/IEEE bus controller counts as a device on its IEC/IEEE bus.

The IEX11 is most commonly used as Controller-in-Charge, but it can
also be used when another device is Controller-in-Charge. The Controller-
in-Charge directs the sequence of information on the bus.

                                                        August 1998

                                                        AE-BW75N-TE

 

When the IEX11 acts as Controller-in-Charge, it may request status in-
formation from other devices through serial and parallel polling. When
the IEX11 is not Controller-in-Charge, it can be polled in either fash-
ion to provide status information.

Features

The DIGITAL IEX-VMS-DRIVER supports the following IEC/IEEE hardware
capabilities:

o  Controller (C1, C2, C3, C4, C5)

o  Talker and Extended Talker (T5, TE5)

o  Listener and Extended Listener (L3, LE3)

o  Automatic Source Handshake (SH1)

o  Automatic Acceptor Handshake (AH1)

o  Service Request (SR1)

o  Remote/Local (RL1)

o  Parallel Poll (PP1, PP2)

o  Device Clear (DC1)

o  Device Trigger (DT1)

The DIGITAL IEX-VMS-DRIVER supports QIO requests to perform the fol-
lowing software functions:

o  Initialize Unit

o  Write Data

o  Read Data

o  Send One IEC/IEEE Bus Command*

o  Send a String of IEC/IEEE Bus Commands*

o  Request Service**

o  Issue a Serial Poll*

                                 2

 

o  Configure Devices for Parallel Polls*

o  Load Parallel Poll Register**

o  Perform a Parallel Poll*

o  Go to Controller-Active-State (CACS)*

o  Go to Controller-Standby-State (CSBS)*

o  Pass Control*

o  Sense Mode

o  Set Mode

o  Enable Event Recognition

o  Recognize Events

The event recognition facility allows the user's process to specify
the events on the IEC/IEEE instrument bus which the interface should
detect. The interface is capable of detecting the occurrence of the
following events:

o  Service Request*

o  Addressed as Listener**

o  Addressed as Talker**

o  Deaddressed**

o  Addressed as Extended Listener**

o  Addressed as Extended Talker**

o  Device Clear**

o  Device Trigger**

o  Remote/Local Change**

o  Parallel Poll Configure**

o  Parallel Poll Unconfigure**

                                 3

 

o  Interface Clear

*  Functions that can only be used by the Controller-in-Charge

** Functions used only by a device that is not Controller-in-Charge

All IEC/IEEE bus commands are issued through a process request and all
data is transferred through the DMA mechanism. When the DIGIAL IEX-
VMS-DRIVER is processing a read data request, the three ways to de-
tect the end of the data transfer are:

o  Byte Count Overflow - Transfer terminates after the specified num-
   ber of bytes have been read.

o  EOI Termination - Transfer terminates if, during the reception of
   a byte, the EOI line is true.

o  Match Character - Transfer terminates after the Termination spec-
   ified match character has been consecutively received the speci-
   fied number of times.

A device exerciser is provided to verify that the DIGITAL IEX-VMS-DRIVER
is correctly installed and to aid the user in testing his application.
When the two bus controllers are connected with a loop back cable (re-
fer to the IEU11-A/IEQ11-A User's Guide), the device exerciser can be
run with command files delivered with the exerciser. These command files
demonstrate all features of the driver and the IEC/IEEE bus interface
functions. The device exerciser can also be used by users in a dia-
logue mode to test their devices. The commands to the exerciser are
directly converted into QIOs to the driver. Using the exerciser in the
dialogue mode, users can quickly determine the set of QIOs required
for their application.

The DIGITAL IEX-VMS-DRIVER may be programmed in the following two ways:






                                 4

 

OpenVMS QIO System Service - The OpenVMS QIO requests allow direct ac-
cess to the driver. These requests can be issued in higher-level lan-
guages (such as VAX FORTRAN, VAX BASIC, VAX Pascal, and MACRO-32). This
is the most flexible way of programming the IEX11 device, but requires
the user to be familiar with the QIO calling procedures.

Simplified User Interface - This is a package of subroutines which can
be called from higher-level languages (such as VAX FORTRAN and VAX BASIC)
to perform the following functions:

IESTRT  -    Initialize an interface

IEPOLL  -    Setup for serial polling

IESEND  -    Send data

IERECV  -    Receive data

IERQSV  -    Request service

IECMD   -    Perform a bus control function

IEWFE   -    Wait for IEC/IEEE bus event

Disk space required for      1,300 blocks
installation:
                             (.7 Mbytes)

Disk space required for      1,000 blocks
use (permanent):

These counts refer to the disk space required on the system disk. The
sizes are approximate; actual sizes may vary depending on the user's
system environment, configuration, and software options.

OPTIONAL HARDWARE

Depending on processor type, up to 3 additional IEU11/IEQ11 modules
may be added to each system for a total of 4 maximum.

CLUSTER ENVIRONMENT

This layered product is fully supported when installed on any valid
and licensed VAXcluster configuration. It must be installed once on
each VAX, MicroVAX, or VAXstation processor on which usage is planned.
