PRODUCT NAME:  Compaq Distributed Computing Environment (DCE) 
Version 3.0 for OpenVMS               SPD 43.05.06

DESCRIPTION

The Compaq Distributed Computing Environment for OpenVMS product 
family provides a set of the distributed computing functionality 
specified for The Open Group's (OSF) Distributed Computing Environment (DCE)
as well as tools for application developers. With DCE, The Open Group
has established a standard set of services and interfaces that 
facilitate the creation, use, and maintenance of client/server applications.
DCE for OpenVMS serves as the basis for an open computing environment
where networks of multivendor systems appear as a single system to the
user. Because DCE makes the underlying networks and operating systems
transparent, application developers can easily build portable, 
interoperable client/server applications. Users can locate and share 
information safely and easily across the entire enterprise. DCE for
OpenVMS supplies system managers with a set of tools to consistently 
manage the entire distributed computing environment, while also assuring
he integrity of the enterprise. The DCE for OpenVMS product family
supports both the OpenVMS VAX and OpenVMS Alpha Operating Systems.

The functionality provided in the DCE for OpenVMS product family includes:

o  DCE Remote Procedure Call (RPC): Used to create and run client/server
   applications, the RPC allows direct calls to remote systems as if
   they were local procedure calls.

o  DCE Distributed Time Service (DTS): Synchronizes time on individual
   nodes in a distributed network environment.

                                                          July 2000

 

o  DCE Security Service: Provides secure communications and access via
   authorization and authentication services.

o  DCE Cell Directory Service (CDS): Provides location-independent naming
   for resources.

o  Global Directory Agent (GDA): The GDA provides a means of linking
   multiple CDS namespaces via either X.500, LDAP, or the Internet 
   Domain Name Server (BIND).

o  DCE code set registry: Provides a mechanism for uniquely identifying
   code sets and the character sets they encode across multiple
   heterogeneous operating systems in an internationalized DCE cell.

o  The Interface Definition Language (IDL) compiler: IDL is the language
   used to define remote procedure calls.

o  Tools and utilities that help manage the DCE environment.

o  RPC_UNSUPPORTED_NETIFS & RPC_SUPPORTED_NETADDRS Support has been
   added for restricting network interfaces and addresses via the 
   logical names RPC_UNSUPPORTED_NETIFS and RPC_SUPPORTED_NETADDRS. This
   can be useful in cluster environments and on systems with more than
   one network interface.

o  Hierarchical Cells can be registered in another cell's CDS namespace,
   allowing the creation of a multi-level control structure.

o  Extended Registry Attributes allow users to modify the security registry
   schema to create and maintain attribute types and to create and
   maintain instances of those types.

o  An Auditing subsystem creates an Audit daemon to maintain filters
   and provide the central audit trail file. Specified APIs provide
   the functions that are used to detect and record critical events.
   The audit service is controlled via the DCE control program (dcecp).

o  DCE V3.0 supports the management features of DCE R1.2.2, including
   the dce daemon (dced), and dce control program (dcecp).

o  MIT Kerberos V5 support: Enables the use of MIT Kerberos 5 authentication
   and key distribution services.

                                 2

 

o  GDA over LDAP support: Enables the use of LDAP by the Global Directory
   Agent in looking up information on foreign cells.

o  NSI over LDAP support: Enables the use of LDAP by the Name Service
   Interface Daemon in looking up information on behalf of Microsoft
   RPC applications.

o  Documentation available in HTML format: DCE documentation from The
   Open Group and Compaq is provided in HTML format to allow reading
   on-line from a web browser.

DCE Privacy allows DCE applications to use the packet privacy protection
level provided by DCE Security Service and is intended to be used
in conjunction with the DCE Runtime Services for OpenVMS VAX and Alpha.
The Privacy feature enables an optional privacy level of encryption
for Remote Procedure Call packets and allows encryption of user
message data via 56-bit DES when calling the GSSAPI or calling the DCE
API's directly.

The DCE Threads Service which provides user-context multiprocessing
functionality is provided as part of the OpenVMS Operating System.

The DCE for OpenVMS product family currently consists of eight 
separate products, four on OpenVMS VAX and four on OpenVMS Alpha, to 
provide customers with maximum flexibility for configuring a DCE 
environment, known as a DCE cell. The products and features include:

o  DCE Runtime Services for OpenVMS, which is required for all systems
   participating in the DCE cell. The DCE Runtime Services kit includes
   DCE client functions as well as DCE administration tools.

o  DCE Application Developers' Kit for OpenVMS, which is required for
   developers of distributed applications, but optional for other users.
   The DCE Application Developers' Kit provides programmers with all
   the DCE API's and the Interface Definition Language (IDL). IDL is
   an easy-to-use, ANSI C-based language for writing remote procedure
   calls.



                                 3

 

o  DCE Cell Directory Server, at least one of which is required for
   each DCE cell. The DCE CDS Server is a central repository containing
   information about the location of resources in the DCE cell. It allows
   access to resources by a single name, regardless of physical location.

o  DCE Security Server, at least one of which is required for each DCE
   cell. The DCE Security Server protects resources from illegal access
   and provides secure communications within and between DCE cells.

The DCE for OpenVMS V3.0 product family is an implementation of OSF
DCE V1.2.2 adapted and enhanced for OpenVMS and has the following features:

o  Integrated Login. This settable feature enables DCE login to occur
   automatically when a user logs in to a standard interactive session.
   At the OpenVMS username and password prompts, the user enters both
   his OpenVMS username and password or his DCE account name and
   password. If valid, the user is logged in to both the OpenVMS
   system and the DCE cell in a single integrated operation.

o  IMPORT and EXPORT utilities to move accounts to and from DCE. The
   DCE IDL compiler for OpenVMS supports Compaq C++, and FORTRAN, as
   well as C.

o  The DCE IDL has been extended to support a number of C++ language
   syntax features that provide a distributed object framework. The
   DCE RPC runtime environment now supports Compaq C++ bindings to
   remote objects.

o  IDL development templates are provided to help with the development
   of client/server interfaces.

o  A PC name server proxy agent is a feature that enables systems running
   Microsoft[R] RPC to obtain CDS bindings.

DCE for OpenVMS also has a single utility that complements the DCE core
services called NSedit. NSedit is a Motif based graphical tool that
enables users to navigate, manipulate, and peruse the CDS name space
much more effectively and efficiently than when using the CDS command
line interface.

                                 4

 

Microsoft RPC Application Programming Interface (API). In addition to
the DCE RPC API, DCE application programmers can now choose to use the
Microsoft RPC API when porting programs from Microsoft platforms.

PRODUCT OPTIONS

The DCE for OpenVMS product family currently consists of eight 
separate products, four on OpenVMS VAX and four on OpenVMS Alpha:

1. DCE Runtime Services Kit for OpenVMS VAX

2. DCE Runtime Services Kit for OpenVMS Alpha

This is a fully integrated set of services that provides applications
with the essential capabilities required to use DCE's distributed 
services. The DCE Runtime Services makes the following DCE features 
available to distributed applications:

o  Remote Procedure Call Runtime API and Library that includes:

   -  Access to DCE RPC

   -  Use of the DCE Cell Directory Service for locating servers

   -  Use of DCE Security Service for authentication

   -  Access to various DCE utilities, including serviceability to 
      assist in debugging client/server applications

   -  DCE Audit Application Programming Interface

   -  GSSAPI - Generic Security Service Application Programming Interface

o  Integrated Login, including IMPORT and EXPORT

o  Administrative tools

o  NSedit

o  PC proxy agent for communication with Microsoft[R] RPC

                                 5

 


A group of DCE systems that work together and are administered as a
unit is called a cell. Every system within a DCE cell must run the DCE
Runtime Services kit.

RPC supports the client/server model that characterizes many distributed
applications. The DCE Runtime Services kit provides such client/server
applications the ability to interoperate over DECnet, TCP/IP, and UDP
/IP network protocols on the OpenVMS operating system. See the section
titled SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS for additional details.

The right-to-use the DCE Runtime Services for OpenVMS is included as
part of the OpenVMS Operating System license. See the section titled
SOFTWARE LICENSING for more detailed information.

4. DCE Application Developers' Kit for OpenVMS Alpha

The DCE Application Developers' Kit for OpenVMS includes tools required
for the development of distributed applications using remote procedure
calls (RPC). It includes:

o  IDL RPC stub compiler

o  Time provider source code routines

o  Sample applications

o  All public DCE application programming interfaces

o  IDL development templates

o  UUIDGEN

                                 6

 

6. DCE Cell Directory Server for OpenVMS Alpha

The DCE Cell Directory Server provides a consistent mechanism for naming
and locating users, applications, files, and systems within a DCE
cell. The DCE CDS also includes the Global Directory Agent (GDA). The
Global Directory Agent provides a means of linking multiple CDS namespaces
via the Internet Domain[R] Name Server (BIND), X.500 or LDAP.

7. DCE Security Server for OpenVMS VAX

8. DCE Security Server for OpenVMS Alpha

The DCE Security Server allows users controlled access to information
in a distributed computing environment safely and confidentially. The
DCE Security Server accomplishes this through two services:

o  DCE Authentication Service allows users and resources to prove their
   identity to each other. The DCE Authentication Service is based on
   Kerberos, which requires that all users and resources possess a secret key.

o  DCE Data Integrity Service protects network data from tampering.
   Cryptographic checksums automatically generated by RPC enable DCE
   to determine whether data has been modified or corrupted in transmission.

To run the DCE Security Server, a DCE-SECURITY license must be loaded
on that system. Additionally, the use of DCE Security requires that
a DCE CDS Server be run on at least one system within the DCE cell.

To run the DCE CDS Server, a DCE-CDS license must be loaded on that
system. Additionally, the use of DCE CDS requires that a DCE Security
Server be run on at least one system within the DCE cell.
