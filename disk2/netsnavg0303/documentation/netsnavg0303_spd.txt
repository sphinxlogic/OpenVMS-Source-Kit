     o  Sorting and listing of messages - Sort and list from subscribed fold-
        ers.

     o  MIME-compliant news reading and posting - Allows multimedia news
        articles.

     o  Fully threaded news reading.

     Security

     Netscape Navigator includes a number of security features to help pro-
     tect your data.

     o  Authentication - Provided for servers with integrated access to
        VeriSign's digital identification services. This provides several
        Levels of assurance to verify the identity of individuals and organ-
        izations that you do business with on the Internet.

     o  Encrypted usenet news/conferencing capabilities by means of SSL sup-
        port for the News (NNTP) protocol.

     o  Support for HTTP over SSL - Provides encrypted transfer of Web pages
        and forms data.

        tions (HTTP or NNTP) through proxy servers.

     o  Dynamic trust capability - Allows users to trust new certificate
        authorities.

     Netscape Navigator Gold Version 3.03 is available in both 40-bit and
     128-bit encryption scheme versions. The difference between 128- and
     40-bit encryption is, most notably, that the U.S. government restricts
     the export of 128-bit encryption but not the export of 40-bit encryp-
     tion. 128 bits and 40 bits refer to the size of the key used to the
     message. 128-bit encryption provides significantly greater cryptographic
     protection than 40-bit encryption.
