PRODUCT NAME:  Compaq TDMS for OpenVMS VAX, Version 1.9B        SPD
25.71.17                (Terminal Data Management System)

DESCRIPTION

Compaq TDMS for OpenVMS VAX (TDMS) is a product designed for the im-
plementation of interactive, forms-intensive applications running on
OpenVMS VAX systems. As a terminal subsystem, TDMS can reduce the ap-
plication development and maintenance effort by replacing application
program logic specific to terminal interactions with definitions that
are external to the program.

TDMS has been superseded by Compaq DECforms for OpenVMS. DECforms is
the preferred forms product for character-cell terminal applications
and should be used for all new application development requiring a forms-
based user interface.

Features

TDMS provides the following features:

o  A Screen Editor to define forms that format data on the terminal.

o  A nonprocedural language to define the exchange of data between an
   application program and its associated terminal. These predefined
   exchanges are called requests and are external to the program.

o  Utilities that enable the creation, modification, and storage of
   form definitions and request definitions.

o  A record-level programming interface that the application program
   uses to invoke the predefined requests. The application program calls
   the program interface, passing it the request name and the program
   record buffers used in the exchange of data with the terminal.

                                                       January 2000

 

o  A sliding window algorithm through which the behavior of TDMS can
   be modified to control how 2-digit year dates are interpreted upon
   input.

TDMS applications range from database inquiry/response/update to real-
time uses such as the periodic display of an industrial process. TDMS
is typically used as a terminal subsystem in terminal data management
applications such as order entry, inventory control, distribution, and
other form-intensive applications. TDMS not only increases applica-
tion development and maintenance productivity by providing a separa-
tion of terminal management code from application code, but it also
promotes end user productivity by providing the following features:

o  Vertical Field Traversal. Keys can be defined for rapidly travers-
   ing forms vertically rather than traversing the form on a field by
   field basis in the predefined field visitation order.

o  Immediate access to the first field and last field. Keys can be de-
   fined for immediately moving the cursor to the first field and the
   last field on the form.

o  The key function associated with a key can be changed and additional
   keys can be defined to have other functions. This allows keyboards
   to be redefined to match the environment of the end user.

o  All TDMS definitions are stored in the Oracle Common Data Dictio-
   nary/Repository (CDD/Repository). Additionally, TDMS can use record
   definitions stored in the Oracle CDD/Repository by Compaq DATATRIEVE,
   Oracle CODASYL DBMS, or Oracle Rdb. TDMS provides full support for
   Oracle CDD/Repository Dictionary Management Utility (DMU) format
   definitions and read-only support for Common Dictionary Operator
   (CDO) definitions.

o  Compaq DATATRIEVE for OpenVMS can use TDMS forms to DISPLAY/READ
   data.

o  TDMS supports editing with the Language-Sensitive Editor from within
   the Request Definition Utility (RDU). This editor provides templates
   that help application developers remember RDU syntax as they de-
   velop request definitions.

                                 2

 

o  TDMS forms can be printed. Video attributes are not printed and lines
   are drawn using the characters "-", "+", "|" rather than a line-
   drawing character set.

Implementing TDMS Applications

1. Define the Request

A request defines what information is displayed at the terminal and
what information is collected from the terminal. The TDMS request re-
places code that would otherwise have to be designed, written, and de-
bugged in the application program.

The request identifies the form and the record definitions to be used
in the exchange of data with the terminal. INPUT and OUTPUT statements
define the mapping between the form fields and the record fields dur-
ing execution of the request.

2. Define the Form

A form definition describes the format of the data that is displayed
on the terminal at run time. The form definition also specifies, for
each field, what validation procedures are invoked. TDMS field val-
idation includes range checks, list checks, and picture validations.

3. Define the Record

Data records that are used in a request and TDMS application program
must be defined in the Oracle CDD/Repository. The record definition
specifies the type, structure, and length of the record that is cre-
ated by Oracle CDD/Repository, Compaq DATATRIEVE, Oracle CODASYL DBMS,
or Oracle Rdb. During the execution of a request, TDMS performs the
necessary data type conversion required to transfer data between the
form and the record.

4. Implement the Application Program

The application program performs application-specific processing and
controls the flow of information between the terminal and the database.
The application communicates at a record level with the terminal by
calling TDMS to execute requests and it communicates with the database

                                 3

 

using the subsystem of choice, including RMS, Compaq DATATRIEVE, Or-
acle CODASYL DBMS, Oracle Rdb, or any other database supported on Open-
VMS VAX.

Applications can be written in any VAX native mode language that ad-
heres to the VAX Procedure Calling and Condition Handling standard.
Many languages are able to copy record definitions from the Oracle CDD/Repository
at compile time. If the application program is written in one of these
languages, then it and the TDMS request can share record definitions
in the Oracle CDD/Repository. TDMS applications written in languages
that do not support such copying must include the record definitions
in the application program itself as well as in the Oracle CDD/Repository.

Components

The Form Definition Utility

The TDMS Form Definition Utility (FDU) provides all of the capabil-
ities needed to create or modify form definitions and store them in
the Oracle CDD/Repository. The TDMS FDU includes a Screen Editor that
is used to create a screen image of the form and assign specific at-
tributes. These include form field video attributes, form field val-
idation procedures, and the order in which the input fields should be
processed.

The Request Definition Utility

The TDMS Request Definition Utility (RDU) provides all of the capa-
bilities needed to create and modify requests and store them in the
Oracle CDD/Repository. RDU validates each request to make sure that
form and record definitions exist and that all transfers of data be-
tween form and record fields are valid. The RDU also builds Request
Library Files that the TDMS run-time system accesses during the ex-
ecution of requests.

The request library capability is provided to avoid run-time access
to the Oracle CDD/Repository and thus improve TDMS application per-
formance.

Programming Call Interface

                                 4

 

An application program uses the TDMS programming interface to execute
a TDMS request. A request defines an exchange of data between the pro-
gram and its associated terminal. The application program calls the
program interface and passes to the program interface the request name
and the program record buffers to be used in the exchange of data with
the terminal. This record level interface thus eliminates the need for
character level or field level communication with the terminal.

The Programming Call Interface allows application programs to perform
additional operations including writing text to or reading text from
the reserved message line on a terminal, enabling or disabling a fa-
cility that traces the action of a request, and canceling a request
in progress.

The Programming Call Interface supports both synchronous and asynchronous
calls from the application program. Optional Run-Time System

An optional run-time version of TDMS is available. The run-time sys-
tem allows for the execution of TDMS-based applications on a system
other than the one used to develop the application.
