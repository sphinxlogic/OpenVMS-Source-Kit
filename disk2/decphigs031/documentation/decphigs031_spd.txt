PRODUCT NAME:  DEC PHIGS Version 3.1 for OpenVMS VAX   SPD 29.38.13

DESCRIPTION

DEC PHIGS[TM] (Programmers Hierarchical Interactive Graphics System)
for OpenVMS[TM] VAX[TM] Systems is a sophisticated three-dimensional
graphics support system that defines, modifies, organizes, and dis-
plays hierarchical, graphical data. DEC PHIGS manages this data in a
conceptually centralized database.

DEC PHIGS for OpenVMS VAX is Digital Equipment Corporation's imple-
mentation of the 1988 ANSI/ISO PHIGS standard for three-dimensional
device-independent graphics. DEC PHIGS supports DECwindows[TM] Motif[R]
for OpenVMS VAX or OpenVMS VAX Workstation Software (VWS), and is sup-
ported on most Digital processors running the OpenVMS VAX Operating
System.

DEC PHIGS is device-independent; the same program can generate graph-
ical output on different devices without modification to the source
code. The graphical output formats supported by DEC PHIGS include:

o  CGM (Computer Graphics Metafile)

o  DDIF[TM] (Digital's Document Interchange Format)

o  Hewlett-Packard[R] Graphics Language (HP-GL[R])

o  PostScript[R]

DEC PHIGS provides five language bindings in which graphical data can
be created and managed: ISO Fortran, ISO C, Ada, DEC C[TM] (Digital's
version of the C binding), and PHIGS$ (a language-independent bind-
ing). Each of these bindings is packaged as a set of shareable images
with which application programs are linked. The shareable images are
then activated at run-time as needed.

                              DIGITAL                    April 1995

                                                        AE-KX14R-TE

 

In addition to the features specified in the PHIGS standard, DEC PHIGS
provides PHIGS PLUS features and GM/EDS extensions. These features and
extensions include:

o  Hidden line/hidden surface removal (HLHSR)

o  Lighting, shading, and depth cueing

o  Additional primitives:

      Circles
      Circular arcs
      Triangle strips
      Quadrilateral meshes
      Indexed polygons
      Trimmed and untrimmed NURBs (nonuniform rational B-splines)

The result of this additional functionality is that application soft-
ware need not generate complex graphics, because these graphics are
provided in graphics libraries.

Functionality Not Supported by DEC PHIGS

The functionality from the PHIGS standard that is not currently im-
plemented in DEC PHIGS is:

o  Modeling clip

o  Metafile functions

o  Cell array

o  Patterns

o  Incremental spatial search

PEX Support

DEC PHIGS supports output to Digital's PEX Version 5.0 and PEX Ver-
sion 5.1 servers. For OpenVMS VAX, the PEX server extension and the
PEXlib object library are included in the DEC PHIGS kit.

                                 2

 

Elements and Structures

In DEC PHIGS, the smallest component of data is an element. One or more
elements can be grouped together in a structure that describes a graph-
ical object. The elements supported by DEC PHIGS include output prim-
itives (polylines, polymarkers, and so on), attribute elements,
transformation and clipping elements, control structure elements, and 
application data elements. These elements can be edited at any time by
an application program.

Structures are maintained in a graphical database known as the struc-
ture store. Graphical output is generated by a structure traversal mech-
anism that interprets the elements in the structure store and displays
them on the screen. This mechanism is called structure mode.

DEC PHIGS provides an alternate traversal mechanism called immediate
mode. In this mode, PHIGS elements can be rendered directly to the dis-
play surface without being placed in the structure store.

Output Primitives

DEC PHIGS provides a variety of output primitive elements for creating
basic two-dimensional and three-dimensional graphics components in the
structure store. These elements are:

Annotation -    Text that is transformed from modeling coordinates
Text            to normalized projection coordinates (always
                readable). This text can be in 8-bit or 16-bit
                format, and can be displayed in a variety of fonts
                and orientations. Text position is affected by
                transformations, but text size is not.

Fill       -    A filled circular area specified by a center point
Circle          and a radius.

Circular   -    An arc of a circle, specified by a center point, a
Arc             radius, and starting and ending angles.

Fill       -    A filled ellipse, specified by a center point, and
Ellipse         major and minor axis vectors.

                                 3

 


Elliptical -    An arc of an ellipse, specified by a center point,
Arc             major and minor axis vectors, and starting and
                ending angles.

Fill       -    A polygonal area that can be hollow or filled
Area            with a uniform color or a hatch style. The edges
                of the area are not defined and cannot be con-
                trolled. A variant of this primitive allows you
                to specify the fill area shape, and thus optimize
                performance.

Fill       -    A set of polygonal areas with holes or disjointed
Area            regions that are treated as a single entity. Con-
Set             trol of edge attributes is provided. A variant of
                this primitive allows you to specify the fill area
                set shape, and thus optimize performance.

Index      -    A set of polygons (possibly nonplanar) that per-
Polygons        mits PHIGS to take advantage of shared vertices.

NURBs      -    A nonuniform rational B-spline, which is a three-
                dimensional curve or surface generated from user-
                specified control points, approximation criteria,
                and possibly trimming curves.

Pixmap     -    A pixmap element formatted for X11 display.

Polyline   -    A set of connected lines defined by a series of
                points and having line type, line width, color,
                and shading attributes defined.

Polyline   -    A collection of polylines.
Set

Polymarker -    One or more symbols that can mark significant
                points in a display and have type, size, scale,
                and color attributes defined.

Quadrila-  -    An array of quadrilaterals, each of which shares
teral Mesh      an edge with the next quadrilateral in the mesh.

                                 4

 


Text       -    A character string at a given position in modeling
                coordinate space. This string can be in 8-bit or
                16-bit format, and can be displayed in a variety
                of fonts and orientations. Text size is affected
                by transformations.

Triangle   -    A sequence of triangles, each of which shares an
Strip           edge with the next triangle in the strip.
Attributes

Each output primitive element has an associated set of attribute
elements that control the primitive's appearance. Attributes can be 
defined in groups (bundles) or individually. Some examples of 
attributes are:

Line       -    The style of a line, for example, dotted or
Type            dashed.

Line       -    The width of the line.
Width

Color      -    The color of the line. You can select one of the
                predefined colors or specify the red, green, and
                blue intensities required to define a particular
                color on color devices.

Character  -    Text attributes, including font, character spacing,
Attributes      height, angle, path, and alignment.

Transformations and Views

DEC PHIGS allows the definition of objects in their own "modeling" 
coordinate systems. Transformation functions are provided to position
these objects with respect to one another in a "world" coordinate 
system.


                                 5

 

World coordinates can have any scale. For example, one application might
have a maximum range from 0 to 1000.0; another application might limit
the range from 0.01 to 0.1. DEC PHIGS automatically converts from world
coordinates to coordinates appropriate for the display device being
used.

The user can control multiple, simultaneous views of the same objects
on one or more display surfaces, as well as the position and size of
the picture on the surface. In addition, DEC PHIGS provides function-
ality for posting structures to specific views, as well as to the dis-
play (as in the standard PHIGS viewing model).

Control Functions

Control functions are used to perform system management tasks related
to the DEC PHIGS environment, the workstation environment, and the graph-
ics display. These tasks include turning DEC PHIGS on and off when 
requested by the application, and directing the flow of graphics data
from the structure store to one or more logical devices.

Inquiry Functions

DEC PHIGS includes a complete set of inquiry functions. These functions 
are used to obtain information about the PHIGS state, the structure 
store, the archive storage, workstation capabilities, or the work-
station state. This information is essential for developing modular,
device-independent programs.

Escape Functions

Escape functions are included with DEC PHIGS to enable access to func-
tionality not provided in the PHIGS standard. The DEC PHIGS escape 
functions include:

o  Anti-aliasing

o  Batch quick updates

o  Double buffering control

                                 6

 

o  Transparency

o  Background pixmap control

o  User-defined line types

o  User-defined marker types

o  Render element range

Logical Input Devices

DEC PHIGS supports synchronous and asynchronous input from the fol-
lowing logical input devices:

Locator   -    Allows the user to select a point on the display.

Stroke    -    Allows the user to input a series of points on the
               display.

Valuator  -    Allows the user to select a real number from a
               given range, for example, by sliding a pointer to a
               position on a radio dial.

Choice    -    Allows the user to make a selection, for example,
               from a list of choices in a menu.

String    -    Allows the user to input a character string, for
               example, as input to a prompt.

Pick      -    Allows the user to select an object that is visible
               on the display. The information returned consists
               of a structure identifier, a pick identifier, and
               an element number for each level in the structure
               network.

Name Sets

Name sets are used by DEC PHIGS to group individual graphic elements
together when determining eligibility for highlighting, visibility,
and picking. For example, in an architectural drawing, all steam pipes
can be grouped in a name set and all water pipes with another. These
sets of pipes can then be made invisible, pickable, or highlighted as
a group.

                                 7

 

Archive Storage

DEC PHIGS provides an interface for archiving files in which all or
part of the structure store can be saved permanently. The structure
store can be accessed later by the same or other applications. Archive
files can be used to:

o  Save and restore graphical information between sessions

o  Transfer graphical information between compatible versions of 
   DEC PHIGS

o  Transfer graphical information between DEC PHIGS applications

o  Store accompanying nongraphical information

Character Fonts

DEC PHIGS includes a series of stroke-precision character fonts. These
character fonts were digitized by Dr. Allen V. Hershey of the Naval
Surface Weapons Laboratory, and supplied to Digital by the National
Bureau of Standards.

Language Bindings

DEC PHIGS functions can be accessed by five sets of subroutine calls
or "bindings," as they are referred to by the PHIGS standards. These
bindings are:

o  An ISO C binding that conforms to the final PHIGS ANSI/ISO C binding
   standard

o  A DEC C binding that conforms to a draft version of the PHIGS C bind-
   ing (provided for compatibility with previous versions of DEC PHIGS)

o  An ISO Fortran binding that conforms to the final PHIGS ANSI/ISO
   Fortran binding standard

o  An Ada binding that conforms to a draft of the PHIGS ANSI/ISO Ada
   binding standard

o  A Digital-specified PHIGS$ binding

                                 8

 

The ISO Fortran, ISO C, and Ada binding interfaces allow users to port
DEC PHIGS applications written in ISO Fortran, ISO C, or Ada to other
operating systems running conformant implementations of DEC PHIGS and
these bindings. Note that calls to the ISO C and DEC C language bind-
ings cannot be mixed with calls to the other language bindings within
the same application.

Graphics Handlers

DEC PHIGS provides support for a wide variety of Digital and non-Digital
graphics devices. For devices that are not supported by Digital, users
can develop their own graphic device handlers using the DEC GKS[TM]
two-dimensional device handler interface.

Device handlers can be developed in DEC Fortran[TM], DEC C, and 
DEC Pascal. For more information on this interface, refer to the Build-
ing a Device Handler System for DEC GKS and DEC PHIGS manual (Order
No. QA-810AK-GZ), which can be purchased separately.

Computer Graphics Metafile (CGM) Output

DEC PHIGS provides support for storing information using the Computer
Graphics Metafile (CGM), an approved ANSI standard format (ANSI 
X3.122-1986). DEC PHIGS supports CGM output for the following formats:

o  Clear Text Encoding - Graphical output data stored in this format
   is easily created, viewed, and modified using a common text editor.
   This format is also suitable for transferring graphical output
   data through networks that support the transfer of text files
   only.

o  Character Encoding - Graphical output data is typically stored in
   this format to reduce the file size. This format is especially suited
   to transfers through networks that do not support binary transfers.

o  Binary Encoding - Graphical output data stored in this format is
   very compact and the fastest to read and write. This format is the
   least suitable for transmission over communication lines because
   all 8 bits in each byte are meaningful.

                                 9

 

CONFORMANCE TO STANDARDS

DEC PHIGS is designed to conform to the following standards:

o  MIT X Window System[TM] Version 11 Release 5 (X11R5).

o  PEX Version 5.0 and 5.1.

o  The ISO C binding conforms to the final PHIGS ANSI/ISO C binding
   ISO/IEC 9593-4:1991.

o  The ISO Fortran binding conforms to the final PHIGS ANSI/ISO For-
   tran binding ISO/IEC 9593-1:1989.

o  The Ada binding conforms to a draft of the PHIGS ANSI/ISO Ada bind-
   ing ISO/IEC 9593-3:1990.

Disk Space Requirements

The disk space requirements for DEC PHIGS depend on the kit you in-
stall, as shown.

DEC PHIGS Development Kit:

Disk space required for      70,000 blocks
installation:
With Ada binding option:     90,000 blocks

Disk space required for      65,000 blocks
use (permanent):
With Ada binding option:     85,000 blocks

                                12

 

DEC PHIGS Run-Time-Only Kit:

Disk space required for      40,000 blocks
installation:

Disk space required for      36,000 blocks
use (permanent):

These counts refer to the disk space required on the system disk. The
sizes are approximate; actual sizes may vary depending on the user's
system environment, configuration, and software options.

Memory Requirements for DECwindows Motif Support

The minimum supported memory for DEC PHIGS running in a standalone 
DECwindows Motif environment, with both the client and server executing
on the same system, is 32 MB. The memory size suggested for most typi-
cal hardware configurations, however, is 64 MB or more, depending on
the system.

The system configuration and performance requirements of DECwindows
Motif applications can determine the memory needed on your system as
follows:

o  Less memory may be required on the client system (where the soft-
   ware is installed and executed) if the server (component display-
   ing the application) resides on another system.

o  More memory may be required on a system where improved performance
   is desired, or where several applications are running.

OPTIONAL HARDWARE

DEC PHIGS for OpenVMS VAX supports the following input device with the
DECwindows Motif device handler:

   Graphics Peripheral Set (32 Function Key Box and 8 Dial Box)

SOFTWARE LICENSING

DEC PHIGS is available in two forms: as a Development Kit and as a Run-
Time-Only Kit. These kits are furnished only under a license.

The Development Kit license enables you to develop and run your own
graphics applications. The Run-Time-Only Kit license allows you to run
applications that were developed on a system where the full DEC PHIGS
product has been installed under a Concurrent Use License option (ex-
plained below). As a result, the Run-Time-Only Kit license is avail-
able at a substantially lower cost per system than the Development Kit
license.
