PRODUCT NAME:  hp DECprint Supervisor (DCPS) for hp OpenVMS,    SPD
44.15.13                Version 2.2

DESCRIPTION

HP DECprint Supervisor (DCPS) for HP OpenVMS is a layered software ap-
plication that runs on OpenVMS Alpha and OpenVMS VAX systems to pro-
vide access to selected PostScript Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3 print-
ers.

DCPS drives selected PostScript printers and supports these printers'
special features, such as tray and media selection and two-sided print-
ing. File formats supported include PostScript, ANSI-Compliant DIGITAL
Printing Protocol Level 3 (DEC PPL3) and HP PCL. DCPS also includes
features such as number-up, layup, automatic data type detection and
high speed image printing, plus translators for a number of printer
languages. See the Other Hardware Required section of the SPD for the
list of supported printer models.

DECprint Supervisor software consists of the following components:

o  A print symbiont that processes print requests for the host on which
   it resides.

o  Software to transmit the request and associated data over the fol-
   lowing protocols:

   -  Ethernet via TCP/IP to a printer connected to a print server or
      a terminal server that supports the bidirectional raw TCP/IP socket
      protocol

   -  Ethernet via TCP/IP to a printer with a network interface card
      (NIC) that supports the bidirectional raw TCP/IP socket proto-
      col

                                                       January 2003

 

   -  Ethernet to a PrintServer printer via DECnet or TCP/IP using Com-
      mon Printer Access Protocol (CPAP)

   -  Local Area Transport (LAT)

   -  Serial line

o  Translators to convert various non-PostScript files into the PostScript
   language for printing.

o  Page formatting capabilities such as the ability to print multi-
   ple page images on a single side of a sheet of paper and to spec-
   ify borders, margins and page offsets.

o  A series of PostScript tools for application developers. These in-
   clude a PostScript error handler and Font Encoding Vectors for the
   ISO Latin Alphabet Number 1 (ISO 8859/1) and DIGITAL Multinational
   Character Set for use with all the PostScript text fonts that are
   built into DIGITAL and selected Compaq PostScript printers.

Install DECprint Supervisor software on each node that has print queues
for PostScript printers.

A system running DECprint Supervisor software can transmit print re-
quests to printers on a TCP/IP, DECnet or LAT network. Note that not
all printers support all these protocols.

To communicate with a printer on a TCP/IP network, HP TCP/IP Services
for HP OpenVMS software, or Process Software MultiNet for OpenVMS or
TCPware for OpenVMS software must be installed on your system.

For DIGITAL PrintServer printers, whether using the TCP/IP or DECnet
protocol, PrintServer Software must be installed on at least one sys-
tem in your network.

Printing Features

o  PostScript printing. The print symbiont passes PostScript files di-
   rectly to the printer. DECprint Supervisor does not interpret or
   translate PostScript files. Therefore, they must be created using
   standard PostScript Level 1, Level 2 or Level 3 operators as de-
   fined within the printer itself.

                                 2

 

o  ANSI (DEC PPL3) printing. DECprint Supervisor translates ANSI files
   into PostScript for printing on the output device. These ANSI files
   may contain ASCII text, sixel graphics and other features of HP's
   ANSI-compliant Printing Protocol Level 3.

o  Selection of input tray via INPUT_TRAY, SHEET_SIZE, or PAGE_SIZE
   parameters and output tray via OUTPUT_TRAY, within the limitations
   of the printer and the tray-naming conventions to provide such fea-
   tures.

o  Rotation of the page via the PAGE_ORIENTATION parameter for non-
   PostScript files only.

o  Selection of single-sided, double-sided, or tumble printing when
   available on the printer, via the SIDES parameter.

o  Formatting of ANSI text files via the /HEADER, /FORM, /SPACE and
   /FEED qualifiers and the TAB parameter.

o  Control of ANSI file margins, page setup and wrap or truncate op-
   tions as specified by the DEFINE/FORM command.

o  Status and error messages sent to the user's terminal, may be printed
   on the job trailer page or job log page, written to a log file, or
   displayed on the operator's console.

o  Use of device control modules for basic data types via the /SETUP
   qualifier. PostScript modules may contain any PostScript operators
   supported by the printer in the printing context.

o  Collection of accounting information for each print job as follows:
   sheets of paper printed, the number of RMS Gets and the number of
   QIO Writes. All Compaq, DIGITAL and GENICOM printers support this
   feature except where noted in the Other Hardware Required section
   of the SPD. This feature may not be available with other printers.

o  Access to the PCL interpreter native to selected printers. Print-
   ers for which the native PCL interpreter is supported are listed
   in the Other Hardware Required section of the SPD.

o  Support for printers via network interface cards, print servers and
   terminal servers that support bidirectional raw TCP/IP sockets.

                                 3

 

o  Support for PrintServer printers on DECnet or TCP/IP interconnects
   using CPAP protocol.

o  Automatic data type detection and switching. The software attempts
   to determine the data type of the file. If successful, it will au-
   tomatically translate, if necessary, and print the file. If it can-
   not determine the file data type, it will use the default data type
   defined by DATA_TYPE=AUTOMATIC.

   If the file is printed using the data type defined by DATA_TYPE=AUTOMATIC,
   the symbiont will look for a switch to PostScript command (%!) and
   continue to process the rest of the file as PostScript. This switch
   may occur only once per file. The switch to PostScript feature is
   not available when DCPS uses a printer's native PCL interpreter to
   process the file.

o  Printing non-PostScript data types on the PostScript printer. Trans-
   lators are provided to translate the following data types into PostScript
   for printing:

   -  DDIF (bitonal Image subset only; requires DECwindows Motif soft-
      ware)

   -  PCL Level 4 (as implemented on the HP LaserJet IID)

   -  IBM Proprinter XL24

   -  ReGIS (monochrome output only)

   -  Tektronix 4010/4014

   -  ASCII LIST translator that formats and numbers ASCII files. This
      translator numbers each line of text, creates alternating bars
      of gray and white in the background and creates a running head
      of the file name and page number.

o  Printing two or more page images on a single side of a sheet via
   the NUMBER_UP parameter.


                                 4

 

o  Specifying page layup features via the LAYUP_DEFINITION parameter.
   Page layup features include Borders, Margins, Margin Alternation,
   Pages Per Sheet, First Page, Page Order and Page Grid. Layup def-
   inition options may be provided directly, as arguments to the LAYUP_
   DEFINITION parameter, or indirectly, as the contents of a file spec-
   ified by that parameter.

o  Specifying a range of pages of the file to be printed via the PAGE_
   LIMIT parameter.

o  Printing jobs with finishing options such as stapling and punch-
   ing, on supported printers equipped with such options.

o  Automatically scaling a page created for one paper size so that it
   fits on a different paper size via use of both the PAGE_SIZE and
   SHEET_SIZE parameters on the same print command.

o  Printing multiple uncollated copies of each sheet via the SHEET_
   COUNT parameter.

o  Use of device control modules for all data types via the /SETUP qual-
   ifier. ANSI modules may include control sequences. PCL modules may
   include binary font data.

o  Support for OpenVMS autostart queues, simplifying startup and en-
   suring high availability of print queues.

ANSI (DEC PPL3) Emulation

Printing of ANSI text and sixel graphics is compatible with DIGITAL's
ANSI-compliant PPL3 printers.

Note: PostScript printers differ in the amount of virtual memory they
have available for printing and font storage. Files that require down-
loading of fonts may be printed differently, may print more slowly or
may fail to print on some printers.
