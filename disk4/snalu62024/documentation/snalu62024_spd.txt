          PRODUCT NAME:  Compaq SNA APPC/LU6.2 Programming       SPD 26.88.10
                         Interface for OpenVMS, Version 2.4

          This SPD describes the Compaq SNA APPC/LU6.2 Programming Interface for
          OpenVMS, which is available for the OpenVMS Operating System for Al-
          pha and VAX platforms. All information applies to both platforms un-
          less otherwise indicated.

          DESCRIPTION

          The Compaq SNA Advanced Program-to-Program Communications/Logical Unit
          6.2 (APPC/LU6.2) Programming Interface for OpenVMS (the APPC product)
          is a layered software product that allows user-written applications
          running on suitably configured OpenVMS systems, either within a DEC-
          net or TCP/IP network or on suitably configured OpenVMS systems within
          an OpenVMS SNA environment to exchange messages with cooperating ap-
          plications in an IBM[R] host. The APPC software exists in the Open-
          VMS system as a shareable image. Access between the cooperating Com-
          paq and IBM applications is via one of the following products:

          TCP/IP or DECnet Connections

          o  Compaq SNA Peer Server

          o  Compaq SNA Domain Gateway

          o  Compaq SNA Access Server for Windows NT[R]

          o  Compaq SNA Server for OpenVMS Alpha, a layered product that sup-
             ports local access as well as TCP/IP and DECnet clients

          DECnet Only Connections

          o  Compaq SNA Gateway for Synchronous Transport

          o  Compaq DECnet SNA Gateway for Channel Transport

                                                                   April 2001

 



          Compaq SNA APPC/LU6.2 Programming                     SPD 26.88.10
          Interface for OpenVMS, Version 2.4

          o  Compaq SNA Server for OpenVMS VAX, a layered product that supports
             local access as well as remote DECnet clients

          The APPC product is a set of subroutines that are called by OpenVMS
          programs which act as LU6.2 transaction application programs. These
          subroutines allow an OpenVMS transaction application to:

          o  Activate and deactivate sessions

          o  Allocate and deallocate LU6.2 basic and mapped conversations

          o  Send and receive data

          o  Request confirmation and confirm transactions

          o  Send and receive error information

          o  Define and delete local LU names and TP names

          o  Supply program initialization parameters

          o  Supply session-level security and inbound conversation level se-
             curity

          o  Allow outbound conversation allocation

          o  Notify the user application of session failure

          o  Notify the user application of conversation deallocation (not ap-
             plicable to Compaq SNA Access Server for Windows NT)

          Features

          The APPC product provides features to assist the user in writing and
          executing the OpenVMS transaction program. The APPC product performs
          the SNA communications function on the programmer's behalf, allowing
          the user to concentrate on solving the application problem rather than
          having to learn about the underlying communications medium. Because
          the APPC product performs all the SNA functions on the user's behalf,
          users are not required to have a knowledge of SNA.

          Compaq SNA APPC/LU6.2 Programming                     SPD 26.88.10
          Interface for OpenVMS, Version 2.4

          The verbs comprising the APPC product are defined to make the indi-
          vidual subroutine calls correspond to the verbs defined in the IBM man-
          ual, SNA Transaction Programmers Reference Manual for Logical Unit 6.2.
          This makes it easier for IBM application-level programmers to code Open-
          VMS LU6.2 programs.

          The APPC product implements both the basic and mapped conversation verb
          set using the same procedure calls. The OpenVMS programmer may choose
          which type of conversation is desired by specifying the appropriate
          symbolic code in the TYPE parameter of the SNALU62$ALLOCATE procedure.

          Both sets of verbs can be synchronous or asynchronous. Asynchronous
          completion of verbs allows for multithreaded applications to use the
          LU6.2 interface without blockage.

          The following sections describe the supported and unsupported verbs.
