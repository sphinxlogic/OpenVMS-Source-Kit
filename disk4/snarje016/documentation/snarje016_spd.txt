          PRODUCT NAME:  Compaq SNA Remote Job Entry             SPD 26.85.08
                         for OpenVMS, Version 1.6

          This SPD describes Compaq SNA Remote Job Entry for OpenVMS, which is
          available for the OpenVMS VAX and OpenVMS Alpha platforms. All infor-
          mation applies to both platforms unless otherwise indicated.

          DESCRIPTION

          Compaq SNA Remote Job Entry for OpenVMS (RJE) is a layered software
          product that allows suitably configured OpenVMS systems within a DEC-
          net[TM] or TCP/IP network to function as an SNA/RJE workstation or group
          of workstations that can transmit batch jobs to an IBM[R] host and re-
          ceive job output. The OpenVMS system user can prepare batch jobs in
          files, submit the jobs, and obtain the job output. Access to the IBM
          SNA host environment is via one of the following SNA server or gate-
          way products:

          TCP/IP or DECnet Connections

          o  Compaq SNA Peer Server

          o  Compaq SNA Domain Gateway

          o  Compaq SNA Access Server for Windows NT[R]

          o  Compaq SNA Server for OpenVMS Alpha, a layered product that sup-
             ports local access as well as TCP/IP and DECnet clients

          DECnet-Only Connections

          o  Compaq DECnet SNA Gateway for Synchronous Transport

          o  Compaq DECnet SNA Gateway for Channel Transport

                                                                   April 2001

 



          Compaq SNA Remote Job Entry                           SPD 26.85.08
          for OpenVMS, Version 1.6

          o  Compaq SNA Server for OpenVMS VAX, an OpenVMS VAX layered product
             that supports local access as well as remote DECnet clients

          By using batch interaction with the IBM host system, RJE can be used
          to submit data that can be used for periodic update of databases and
          other applications. Easily modified translation tables resident in ei-
          ther the SNA server or gateway convert ASCII code to a subset of IBM
          multinational EBCDIC for transmission to the IBM host, and from EBCDIC
          to ASCII on reception of job output.

          Features

          RJE offers the following features:

          o  Each workstation includes a console interface that an operator can
             use to communicate with the Job Entry System in the IBM host.

          o  RJE can support record sizes of up to 254 characters.

          o  RJE supports data compression on reader streams and data decompres-
             sion on printer and punch streams.

          o  ASCII to EBCDIC translation is transparent to the user but can be
             inhibited with the /NOTRANSLATE qualifier on the ASSIGN command.

          Sending Jobs to the IBM Host

          Workstation users submit jobs to OpenVMS queues. The workstation trans-
          mits the queued jobs to the IBM host over the input streams associ-
          ated with a queue.

          This queuing technique makes it possible for many RJE users to sub-
          mit jobs at the same time and to do so even if the workstation is in-
          active. When the operator sets the workstation on, the workstation trans-
          mits all the jobs in its queues. For each submitted job, the user spec-
          ifies one or more files containing JCL (Job Control Language) state-
          ments, data, or programs.

          Receiving Job Output

          The IBM host returns job output to a workstation over various output
          streams. Each IBM output stream will have an OpenVMS directory assigned
          to it. As output from jobs is received on an output stream, it is as-
          signed a file name identical to the name given to the job as it is ex-
          ecuted in the IBM system (normally names are specified by user-supplied
          JCL). This mechanism allows easy identification of a particular job
          when several users share the same job stream. In the SNA gateway en-
          vironment, job output may be directed to a system on the network other
          than the initiating system.

          Managing the Workstation

          OpenVMS users with the required privilege can issue a set of restricted
          commands to manage the workstation. These commands allow the user to
          initialize and control the workstation, and to communicate interac-
          tively with the IBM batch subsystem. The following functions are avail-
          able:

          o  Set the workstation ON and OFF

          o  Stop the transmission of a job

          o  Collect logging information in a disk file

          o  Display status

          o  Obtain online help information

          Specifying a Server

          Users of Compaq DECnet SNA Gateway for Channel Transport or Compaq DEC-
          net SNA Gateway for Synchronous Transport have the option of running
          the RJE Server on the SNA gateway (the default) or on the the Open-
          VMS node. By running the RJE Server on the OpenVMS node, you can uti-
          lize idle OpenVMS resources, thus reducing the SNA gateway's resource
          usage and increasing the throughput.
