          PRODUCT NAME:  Compaq DECnet[TM] SNA Gateway for       SPD 25.C6.06
                         Synchronous Transport, Version 1.3

          DESCRIPTION

          Compaq DECnet SNA Gateway for Synchronous Transport (DECnet SNA Gateway-
          ST) is a member of the DECnet SNA Gateway product family. This fam-
          ily consists of hardware and software products that allow users to ex-
          change information and share resources bidirectionally between suit-
          ably configured Compaq systems in a DECnet environment and IBM[R] sys-
          tems in a Systems Network Architecture (SNA) environment.

          Users on one or more Compaq systems can simultaneously perform func-
          tions such as accessing IBM application programs or other system re-
          sources, act as a 3270 display station, perform data transfer between
          Compaq and IBM file systems, exchange electronic documents and mail
          messages, submit jobs to IBM batch subsystems acting as a Remote Job
          Entry workstation, and implement distributed, task-to-task applica-
          tion programs that run between Compaq and IBM systems.

          The DECnet SNA Transport product set provides a means of connecting
          DECnet and SNA networks that can be used by a wide variety of Compaq-
          supplied access routines running on OpenVMS Alpha, OpenVMS VAX, and
          Tru64 UNIX operating environments. DECnet SNA Gateway-ST is managed
          and configured using the DECnet SNA gateway management software that
          is part of the Compaq DECnet SNA Gateway-ST product. For additional
          information on the various access routines and their capabilities, see
          the Optional Software section of this Software Product Description.

          Compaq DECnet SNA Gateway-ST is part of both the DECnet and the SNA
          networks. Architecturally, it is a DECnet Phase IV end node implemen-
          tation to DECnet and a Physical Unit (PU) Type 2.0 to SNA. It provides
          bidirectional network access between DECnet and SNA networks.

                                                                   April 2001

 



          Compaq DECnet[TM] SNA Gateway for                     SPD 25.C6.06
          Synchronous Transport, Version 1.3

          Compaq DECnet SNA Gateway-ST works with either of the DEC[TM] MicroServer
          hardware platforms. The DEC MicroServer (DEMSA-S*) provides connec-
          tivity for up to four synchronous lines and the DEC MicroServer-SP (DEMSB-
          S*) provides a single synchronous line connection.

          Note: In this document, the term "DEC MicroServer" refers to either
          hardware device, unless specifically stated otherwise. The DEC MicroServer
          hardware devices are no longer available from Compaq, but are still
          supported. For details, please contact your local Compaq representa-
          tive.

          The DEC MicroServer provides physical connectivity to an Ethernet lo-
          cal area network (LAN) and, when used in conjunction with Compaq DEC-
          net SNA Gateway-ST software, it provides SNA connectivity to any DEC-
          net system in a DECnet network.

          This product can be used in networks currently using other DECnet SNA
          Gateway systems and can share access routines, Ethernet LANs, and load
          host resources with those systems.

          Compaq DECnet SNA Gateway-ST software is downline loaded into the DEC
          MicroServer system. The gateway management software, which is part of
          Compaq DECnet SNA Gateway-ST, is required for the OpenVMS node des-
          ignated as the load host for Compaq DECnet SNA Gateway-ST. Other DEC-
          net systems wishing access to the SNA network through the DEC MicroServer
          should be configured with the appropriate DECnet SNA access routines.

          Compaq DECnet SNA Gateway-ST V1.3 supports SNA synchronous communi-
          cations using the SDLC protocol. The number of links supported depends
          on the hardware unit being used (DEC MicroServer or DEC MicroServer-
          SP), line speeds required by the customer, and the electrical inter-
          face used. Table 1 shows the configuration matrix for connecting to
          the SNA network.

          Lines connected to the DEC MicroServer or DEC MicroServer-SP should
          be configured according to guidelines specified in the Compaq DECnet
          SNA Gateway-ST user documentation.

          Features

          o  NRZI support - Signaling mode for the line(s) from the Gateway to
             the IBM system can be set to NORMAL or NRZI (non-return-to-zero-
             inverted) so that line characteristics match those set in the IBM
             ACF/NCP LINE macro.

          o  Support for FULL duplex transmission - Circuits can be set FULL du-
             plex to allow data to be sent and received simultaneously on full
             duplex lines. This setting corresponds to DATMODE=FULL in the IBM
             ACF/NCP PU macro.

          o  Support for RECFMS - The Gateway can send Record Formatted Main-
             tenance Statistics (RECFMS) messages to the IBM system. These mes-
             sages contain counters requested by the IBM Network Problem Deter-
             mination Application (NPDA) using Request Maintenance Statistics

             (REQMS) messages. Not all RECFMS messages are supported by the Gate-
             way. Refer to the DECnet SNA Gateway-CT and -ST Management user doc-
             umentation for more information.

          o  A simplified configuration procedure - After installing Gateway-
             ST gateway management software, a single configuration procedure
             is run which creates command procedures that define items for the
             DECnet database on the load host, and the SNA and DECnet databases
             on the Gateway.

          o  Extended SDLC - Support for Extended Response Mode SDLC (Modulo 128).

          When Using DEC MicroServer Hardware

          o  Synchronous line support - Compaq DECnet SNA Gateway-ST supports
             up to four SDLC connections at speeds of 64 Kbs/circuit or less,
             two connections at 128 Kbs/circuit, or a single connection at 256
             Kbs.

          o  Session support - Compaq DECnet SNA Gateway-ST supports up to 128
             concurrent (Logical Unit) sessions for selected access routines.

          When Using DEC MicroServer-SP Hardware

          o  Synchronous line support - Compaq DECnet SNA Gateway-ST supports
             one SDLC connection at up to 19.2 Kbps.

          o  Session support - Compaq DECnet SNA Gateway-ST supports up to 32
             concurrent (Logical Unit) sessions for selected access routines.

          Loading Compaq DECnet SNA Gateway-ST Software

          The DEC MicroServer requires software to be loaded into memory before
          DECnet SNA Gateway operation. Compaq DECnet SNA Gateway-ST software
          is downline loaded into the hardware across the Ethernet LAN from an
          OpenVMS Alpha or OpenVMS VAX system acting as a DECnet load host sys-
          tem.

          Most Alpha and VAX systems running OpenVMS software are supported as
          Ethernet load hosts for Compaq DECnet SNA Gateway-ST. Supported Open-
          VMS configurations are described in the OpenVMS Operating System for
          Alpha and VAX Software Product Description (SPD 25.01.xx).

          Synchronous Transport, Version 1.3

          DECnet SNA Gateway Management Software

          DECnet SNA gateway management software, which is part of the DECnet
          SNA Gateway-ST, provides configuration and management functions for
          use with Compaq DECnet SNA Gateway for Synchronous Transport. This man-
          agement software allows the gateway administrator to configure the soft-
          ware executing in the Compaq DECnet SNA Gateway-ST system. The admin-
          istrator can set up parameters relating to lines, circuits, physical
          units, logical units, and other key variables necessary for network-
          to-network communications between the DECnet and SNA networks. In ad-
          dition, the software allows the administrator to manage and diagnose
          problems related to the Compaq DECnet SNA Gateway-ST.

          DECnet SNA gateway management software is required on the Compaq load
          host node for Compaq DECnet SNA Gateway-ST. It must also be present
          on any other OpenVMS node where users want to manage Compaq DECnet SNA
          Gateway-ST and the DEC MicroServer. It is strongly recommended that
          the software also be installed on OpenVMS systems in order to facil-
          itate debugging functions where IBM Interconnect application programs
          are developed using the DECnet SNA Programming Interface products.

          Gateway management software includes DECnet style network management
          tools for configuring, controlling, monitoring, and troubleshooting
          Compaq DECnet SNA Gateway-ST. These activities are generally performed
          by the Compaq system manager responsible for the designated load host
          node. Most management functions are performed from a node on the Com-
          paq network rather than at or on the Gateway itself.

          Management of the DECnet SNA Gateway-ST should be viewed as part of
          the Compaq environment, while management of the synchronous circuits
          connecting the DECnet SNA Gateway to the IBM network is a joint re-
          sponsibility of the IBM and Compaq system managers.

          DECnet SNA gateway management software allows a Compaq system oper-
          ator to bootstrap or restart a DECnet SNA Gateway remotely and pro-
          vide configuration and initialization facilities for the DECnet SNA
          Gateway.

          Synchronous Transport, Version 1.3

          In addition to event logging and error counters, a wide range of fault
          isolation tools are included.

          Trace capabilities SNATRACE and NETTRACE for OpenVMS are provided with
          Compaq DECnet SNA Gateway-ST to help debug application programs as well
          as assist in identifying system problems. An operator can run a trace
          at the Circuit, Physical Unit (PU), or Session level, and then for-
          mat the data on a specified Compaq system. The trace features are help-
          ful in identifying an error for remedial action.

          A snapshot monitoring utility is provided to display on Compaq host-
          controlled terminal the status of the gateway's buffer availability,
          the number of SNA sessions currently in progress, and other informa-
          tion that pertains to both the DECnet and SNA network.

          If an irrecoverable error should occur during operation of the DEC-
          net SNA Gateway system, a memory image may be dumped to a designated
          Ethernet-attached Alpha or VAX host. This memory image may then be pro-
          vided to your Compaq support personnel for problem diagnosis.

          INSTALLATION

          Only experienced customers should attempt installation of this prod-
          uct. Installation services from Compaq recommended for all other cus-
          tomers. These services provide for installation of the software prod-
          uct by an experienced software specialist.

          Communications Hardware Requirements

          DEC MicroServer

          Compaq DECnet SNA Gateway-ST software runs on the DEC MicroServer unit,
          which is supported in the following forms:

          o  DEMSA-AA for use with 120V AC power supplies

          o  DEMSA-AB for use with 240V AC power supplies

          The DEC MicroServer has a built-in LAN controller but needs a suit-
          able connection to connect to the customer's LAN, together with any
          necessary extension cables.

          The DEC MicroServer uses adapter cables to provide the necessary in-
          terchange circuits at the appropriate electrical interface types and
          ISO standard connections for each synchronous line. One of these ca-
          bles is needed for each line used. Table 2 shows the cable numbers for
          each of the electrical interface types.
