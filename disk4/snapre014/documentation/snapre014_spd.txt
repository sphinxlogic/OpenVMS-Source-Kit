          PRODUCT NAME:  Compaq SNA Printer Emulator             SPD 26.70.09
                         for OpenVMS, Version 1.4

          This SPD describes Compaq SNA Printer Emulator for OpenVMS, which is
          available for the OpenVMS Alpha and OpenVMS VAX platforms. All infor-
          mation applies to both platforms unless otherwise indicated.

          DESCRIPTION

          Compaq SNA Printer Emulator for OpenVMS (PrE) is an OpenVMS layered
          software product that allows suitably configured OpenVMS systems to
          receive printable data from IBM host-based applications. These appli-
          cations will originally have been developed to produce output for an
          IBM 3287 printer in system mode that is connected to an IBM 3274 clus-
          ter controller in a Systems Network Architecture (SNA) networking en-
          vironment. Access from the IBM system to OpenVMS systems is via one
          of the following SNA servers or gateways:

          TCP/IP or DECnet Connections

          o  Compaq SNA Peer Server

          o  Compaq SNA Domain Gateway

          o  Compaq SNA Access Server for Windows NT[R]

          o  Compaq SNA Server for OpenVMS Alpha, a layered product that sup-
             ports local access as well as TCP/IP and DECnet clients

          DECnet Only Connections

          o  Compaq DECnet SNA Gateway for Synchronous Transport

          o  Compaq DECnet SNA Gateway for Channel Transport

          o  Compaq SNA Server for OpenVMS VAX, an OpenVMS VAX layered product
             that supports local access as well as remote DECnet clients

                                                                   April 2001

 



          Compaq SNA Printer Emulator                           SPD 26.70.09
          for OpenVMS, Version 1.4

          In an actual IBM 3287 environment, data transfer is one way (from host
          to printer) and generates hard copy. The PrE Access software will al-
          low OpenVMS users to direct the received output either to be printed
          via the OpenVMS Print Symbiont or spooled to a disk file.

          Features

          The following is a summary of functions provided by PrE:

             guage (DCL) style interface for ease of use.

          o  PrE can accept data in SNA Character String (SCS) format (LU type
             1) and 3270 Data Stream format (LU type 3).

          o  PrE recognizes the following 3270 Data Stream orders:

                CR - Carriage Return
                DUP - Duplicate (converted to a semicolon)
                EM - End Message

                INP - Inhibit Presentation
                SLD - Set Line Density

          o  PrE supports the 3287 printer Program Attention (PA1 and PA2) keys
             and the CANCEL PRINT key using commands entered at the user inter-
             face.

          o  PrE does not support the Printer Authorization Matrix feature, and
             it does not emulate the 3287's REPRINT key function.

          o  PrE supports 1 to 255 copies of the print job to be printed.

          o  PrE supports a maximum of 250 sessions simultaneously.

          o  PrE supports the ability to submit a print job for another user.
             The print job will run exactly as if that user submitted the re-
             quest. Accounting information is logged to that user's account. The
             user name string can be 1 to 12 characters in length and should be
             a valid user name on the system.

          o  PrE supports multiple form types. The form type is specified by us-
             ing either a numeric value or a form name. These form types can re-
             fer to the print image width, length, or type of paper. Codes for
             these form types are installation defined.
