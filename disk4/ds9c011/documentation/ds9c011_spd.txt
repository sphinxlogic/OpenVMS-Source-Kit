 PRODUCT NAME:  DECserver 90 TL Software, Version 1.1c  SPD 38.71.04

 DESCRIPTION

 DECserver 90TL Software, Version 1.1c is an enhanced software release
 for the DECserver 90TL.

 The DECserver 90TL software provides concurrent Local Area Transport
 (LAT) and Telnet TCP/IP protocol support from a DECserver 90TL com-
 munications server to enable connectivity to host systems that uti-
 lize LAT or TCP/IP protocols. The TCP/IP protocol suite is used to con-
 nect to UNIX[R] host systems and other host systems that support the
 TCP/IP protocol suite.

 The DECserver 90TL Communications Server is an Ethernet Communications
 Server for Ethernet Local Area Networks (LANs). The DECserver 90TL pro-
 vides a convenient method to logically connect up to eight digital asyn-
 chronous terminals to one or more service nodes (hosts) on an Ether-
 net. Once the terminal is connected, a user can utilize application
 programs and utilities as though the terminal was directly connected
 to a host via a DMF32, DHU11, or DHV11/DHQ11 device, with a few ex-
 ceptions. Thus, it may be possible to utilize the DECserver 90TL to
 connect all terminals to service nodes in place of traditional inter-
 faces, except for host console terminals.

 In addition, the DECserver 90TL provides IP end-node routing via SLIP
 (Serial Line Internet Protocol). Up to eight TCP/IP systems can be con-
 nected to the serial ports of the DECserver 90TL. These systems can
 run IP applications (such as Telnet, FTP[R], X-Windows, etc.) on the
 serial line and communicate with other TCP/IP services on the network.



                               DIGITAL                   August 1997

                                                         AE-PME5E-TE

 

 The DECserver 90TL uses MJ8 (similar to RJ45 jacks used in telephone
 jacks) for the attachment of asynchronous devices. The DECserver 90TL
 utilizes the DEC 423-A electrical interface standard for local con-
 nections. DEC 423-A is compatible with the DEC 232-D interface and sup-
 ports DTR/DSR (Data Terminal Ready/Data Set Ready) signals. DEC 423-
 A supports longer cable runs and higher signaling speeds.

 The DECserver 90TL supports reverse LAT and Telnet Listener. These can
 be used to share the load on asynchronous devices connected to the DEC-
 server 90TL. A group of ports can each be defined as the same service.
 With reverse LAT, if the node from which the service request is ini-
 tiated is properly configured, the service request will be sent to the
 port with the highest capacity rating.

 The DECserver 90TL also allows for host-initiated connections to se-
 rial printers. A print symbiont on service nodes can initiate connec-
 tions to serial printers connected to DECserver 90TL ports. This al-
 lows the printers to be distributed throughout a facility and accessed
 transparently by service node users. Incoming host-initiated connect
 requests can be queued FIFO at the server.

 Port-to-port connections on the same server are also supported.

 The DECserver 90TL implements the LAT protocol for communication with
 service nodes that implement this protocol on the same Ethernet. This
 interface has been optimized for high terminal I/O performance over
 an Ethernet, while reducing host CPU cycles required to handle inter-
 rupts. Hence, under most I/O loading conditions, a significant per-
 formance gain can be realized by using the DECserver 90TL versus di-
 rect terminal connections via traditional asynchronous backplane com-
 munications interfaces.

 The DECserver 90TL also implements the TCP/IP protocol suite for com-
 munication with host systems that implement TCP/IP. The TCP/IP imple-
 mentation is based on the University of California's 4.3 Berkeley Soft-
 ware Distribution (BSD). The following TCP/IP protocols are supported
 and adhere to the Defense Data Network (DDN) Request for Comments:



                                  2

 

 o  Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is the Internet standard trans-
    port level protocol that provides the reliable, end-to-end full du-
    plex, stream service that supports many application protocols (RFC793).

 o  Bootstrap Protocol (BOOTP) is the Internet standard protocol for
    downloading software that is on the DECserver 90TL (RFC951); also,
    BOOTP Vendor Information Extensions (RFC1084), the TFTP protocol
    (RFC783), and Bootstrap Loading using TFTP (RFC906).

 o  User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is an Internet protocol that provides
    datagram service to application programs, allowing an application
    program on one machine to send a datagram to an application pro-
    gram on another machine. UDP is necessary for the Domain[R] Name
    System and the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) (RFC 768).

 o  Internet Protocol (IP) is an Internet standard protocol that de-
    fines the Internet datagram as the unit of information that gets
    passed across the Internet, and provides the universal addressing
    scheme for hosts and gateways for Internet connection-less, best
    effort packet delivery services. IP includes ICMP as an integral
    part (RFC 791).

 o  Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) is an Internet network pro-
    tocol that specifies error and control messages used with the In-
    ternet protocols (RFC 792).

 o  Packet Internet Groper (PING) tests the reachability of nodes on
    the users' Internet. ICMP echoes requests are sent and replies pro-
    cessed.

 o  Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) is an Internet protocol used to
    perform dynamic address resolution to dynamically map or translate
    an Internet address into the correct physical hardware address (RFC
    826).

 o  Telnet is the standard Internet application level protocol for re-
    mote terminal connection service. Telnet is a virtual terminal fa-
    cility that allows a user at one site to establish a TCP connec-
    tion to a remote system. Telnet makes the local terminal appear as

                                  3

 

    a direct extension of the remote system, allowing the user to con-
    duct a session and run application programs as if the user's ter-
    minal were directly connected to the remote system (RFC 854).

    Both Telnet client and server capabilities are provided:

    -  Telnet client provides the ability to connect to any remote TCP
       port at an Internet address on a Local Area Network (LAN) or a
       Wide Area Network (WAN). Telnet client allows the user to spec-
       ify a remote computer by Internet address as well as by domain
       name.

    -  Telnet server provides the ability to accept connection requests
       from Internet hosts on a LAN or WAN to DECserver 90TL ports, such
       as printers, host systems, or other serial devices.

    -  Telnet character and binary profiles are supported for Inter-
       net sessions. Telnet options supported include: status (RFC 859),
       end of record (RFC 885), remote flow control (RFC 1080), echo
       (RFC 857), timing mark (RFC 860), binary (RFC 856), and suppress
       go ahead (RFC 858).

    -  Telnet Remote Console allows a user to establish a remote Tel-
       net connection to the management port on the terminal server and
       manage the server as if locally attached. The Telnet listener
       23 can now be assigned to any server port as well as the remote
       console. Any Telnet listener (23, 2001-20016) can be assigned
       to be the remote console.

 o  Internet Domain Name System (DNS) Support. The Domain Name System
    provides the translation from system name to Internet address. The
    DECserver 90TL will interface to user programs and send queries to
    domain name servers for translating domain names to Internet ad-
    dresses, and Internet addresses to domain names (RFCs 1034, 1035).

 o  Subnet Addressing (RFC 950).

 o  Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP). The SNMP agent allows
    the DECserver 90TL to be managed by an SNMP network management sys-
    tem. Retrieving information from the terminal server is possible
    using the SNMP GET and GET-NEXT requests. The SNMP SET operation

                                  4

 

    is fully supported providing the ability to modify DECserver pa-
    rameters as well as create and delete applicable table entries. The
    server can send unsolicited event alarms to specified SNMP manage-
    ment stations via the SNMP TRAP message. Server variables acces-
    sible via SNMP (RFC 1157) are defined by the Internet documents:
    MIB II (RFC 1213), RS232-like MIB (RFD 1317), the Character MIB (RFC
    1316).

 o  Serial Line Internet Protocol (SLIP). A host computer that supports
    SLIP can use the DECserver 90TL serial port as it's network con-
    nection. This gives IP end nodes, which have no Ethernet controller,
    access to the network and to other serial-line attached TCP/IP end
    nodes. Any IP application (such as MAIL, X-Windows, NFS[R], Rlogin,
    FTP, etc.) can then be run over the SLIP link (RFC 1055).

 The DECserver 90TL also implements and supports the Terminal Device
 /Session Management Protocol (TD/SMP) to manage multiple sessions at
 the device level. The DECserver 90TL provides the ability to commu-
 nicate with terminals that also implement this protocol (such as VT420,
 VT330+, or VT340+), and to assist in the management of multiple ses-
 sions for these devices. By implementing this protocol, the DECserver
 90TL can permit attached devices to maintain screen and keyboard con-
 text for multiple LAT and/or Telnet sessions, as well as allow these
 devices to run multiple LAT and/or Telnet sessions concurrently.

 The DECserver 90TL implements the ODL (On Demand Loading) font load-
 ing protocol that allows Asian terminals that implement the ODL pro-
 tocol (such as VT382 or VT282) to communicate with an OpenVMS[*] host
 via a terminal server. The Asian terminals will be able to request font
 definitions from an OpenVMS host when connected to a DECserver 90TL.
 This feature is supported only for LAT connections.

 Software that runs on the DECserver 90TL is downline loaded over the
 network from a load host using MOP or BOOTP/TFTP. Terminal access us-
 ing the DECserver 90TL does not require DECnet running in the same ser-
 vice node; LAT uses the Ethernet addressing mechanism to transport ter-
 minal messages.

 Features such as login load balancing, multiple terminal sessions, au-
 tomatic failover, and remote printer support are provided and can lead
 to greater user productivity.

 For wide area network communications, terminal users can connect to
 remote hosts via Telnet through a TCP/IP router or gateway.

 Features

 Terminal Connection Management

 Through the use of a simple command, users can establish a logical con-
 nection, called a session, to any service node that implements the LAT
 or Telnet protocol on the same Ethernet LAN, or to a remote host that
 implements the TCP/IP protocol suite. This connection makes the ter-
 minal appear as if it were physically connected to the service node,
 and the terminal user can use standard system utilities and applica-
 tions supported by that node. Each terminal connected to the server
 can connect to the same or a different service node on the Ethernet.
 Furthermore, several servers can be used to connect many terminals to
 one or more service nodes.

 A service node can have one or more services that are offered to DEC-
 server 90TL users. Services and nodes are identified by name. Users
 always connect to services, not to nodes, although often one of the
 service names will be the node name.

 In a VAXcluster environment, the DECserver 90TL sees each VAXcluster
 on the Ethernet as a collection of service nodes offering a common ser-
 vice. Each cluster node may also offer a service whose name is equiv-
 alent to its node name. In this case, a terminal user can connect ei-
 ther to the cluster service or a service associated with a particu-
 lar cluster node. Load Balancing

 When a connection is made to a service, the actual node for the con-
 nection is determined by load balancing. Load balancing is a process
 the server uses when more than one node offers the same service. Ser-
 vice nodes do not have to be configured in a cluster in order for load
 balancing to be used. Service nodes with the same names may be run-
 ning different operating systems. Using the load balancing process,

                                  6

 

 the server connects to the node with the highest rating for the ser-
 vice desired. This rating is based on the current loading on the nodes
 that offer the service.

 This feature is supported only for LAT connections.

 Multiple Sessions

 The DECserver 90TL allows each user to establish and maintain up to
 eight sessions to one or more service nodes, up to a maximum of 64 per
 DECserver 90TL. Only one session per user can be active at a time. Through
 simple switching commands, the user can access the different sessions
 without repeating a login dialogue each time. Some operating systems
 may impose limits on the number of LAT or Telnet sessions that a host
 will support.

 Multiple Session Management

 The DECserver 90TL server allows direct communication with devices that
 support the TD/SMP protocol. This protocol provides the ability for
 the attached device to maintain screen and keyboard context for the
 multiple LAT or Telnet sessions that the DECserver 90TL provides. By
 implementing the ability to directly communicate with this protocol
 to the attached device, the DECserver 90TL can now assist in the man-
 agement of context of these multiple sessions, as well as allow for
 simultaneous output to multiple LAT or Telnet sessions being maintained
 by the device.

 Outbound Connection Queues

 If a terminal user requests a connection to a server, and the requested
 service is currently in use, the server user may opt to have the re-
 quested connection queued to the remote service. If the user's port
 has been appropriately configured, this feature happens automatically
 whenever a connection fails for this reason. The connection request
 is queued at the service node end and is processed first-in/first-out
 until such time as the user's connection request can be completed. This
 feature assists in the fair management of limited network resources.
 Once queued for connection, the user also has the option to cancel the
 queue entry and proceed with other sessions. This feature is supported

                                  7

 

 only for LAT connections. Similar functionality may be available via
 a print filter program on a Telnet host. Command Line Recall and Edit-
 ing

 The DECserver 90TL server supports multiple command line entry recall
 and editing.

 Welcome Identification

 The DECserver 90TL server standard welcome banner, which includes com-
 munications server type, version number, internal base level, and pro-
 tocol version number, is issued whenever a user successfully logs in
 to the server. The server will also print a Server-Manager-settable
 identification string. This can be useful for automatic server iden-
 tification or for small daily messages used for communication with the
 server users.

 Local Mode and Service Mode

 For the most part, the environment provided by the DECserver 90TL is
 identical to the environment the user would experience if attached di-
 rectly to the service node. When operating in this mode, the user is
 said to be in Service Mode. Occasionally, such as during connection
 establishment, the user interacts directly with the DECserver 90TL.
 When operating in this mode, the user is in Local Mode.

 In Local Mode, the terminal input is interpreted directly by DECserver
 90TL as commands to be performed by the server.

 Local Mode has three different levels of privilege: privileged, non-
 privileged, and secure. Privileged mode is provided for the Server Man-
 ager to control the environment of the server and of the terminal users.
 Access to this mode is password protected. Nonprivileged commands al-
 low the terminal user to control service sessions, set the port char-
 acteristics, and show server information. The Server Manager can set
 the server to secure mode on a per-port basis, which further limits
 the commands users can enter to only those that directly relate to the
 user's own port.


                                  8

 

 Additional commands and displays to support the features available with
 the TD/SMP protocol are usable in Local Mode. These commands will be
 used to enable or disable server recognition of the TD/SMP commands.

 The Server Manager environment is a logical extension of the user en-
 vironment. The Server Manager is treated as a server user with a priv-
 ileged status. The Server Manager sets a terminal to this status us-
 ing a command that requires a password. This privileged status allows
 the Server Manager to enter commands not normally available to server
 users. These commands set server characteristics, provide control over
 server port usage, and provide the ability to control the user's ac-
 cess to the server and network services.

 In Service Mode, the terminal input is passed directly to the connected
 service node with several exceptions. One exception, called the lo-
 cal switch character, allows the user to enter Local Mode from Ser-
 vice Mode. The BREAK key can also be used for this function. Other ex-
 ceptions, called the forward and backward switch characters, allow the
 user to switch between sessions without the need to enter local mode.
 The switch characters are disabled by default but can be enabled by
 command. Both CTRL/S and CTRL/Q are normally interpreted locally, but
 flow control using these characters can be disabled.

 Autoconnection

 Autoconnection is a function that automatically connects a user ter-
 minal to a service node when connection failures occur or upon user
 login to the server. In conjunction with this function, a dedicated
 or preferred service can be specified for each terminal user.

 If a dedicated service is specified, the DECserver 90TL will attempt
 to connect to that service when a character is typed on the terminal
 keyboard or when an existing connection fails. In dedicated service
 mode, only one session is available. As this mode is designed to sim-
 ulate a direct terminal connection, no local mode commands or messages
 are available to the terminal user. Ports with dedicated service can
 be logged out of the server automatically when the user logs out of
 the service node.


                                  9

 

 If a preferred service is specified, the DECserver 90TL will attempt
 to connect to that service as with the dedicated service mode of op-
 eration. However, the terminal user can enter local mode and estab-
 lish other sessions.

 Automatic Protocol Selection

 It is possible to connect to an Internet host or LAT service automat-
 ically without explicitly identifying the connection as LAT or Tel-
 net. If the port is configured with a value for the default protocol
 as "ANY," the server will attempt a LAT connection first to the name
 specified in the LAT service field. If the service is not available
 or unknown, the server will then automatically attempt a Telnet con-
 nection to the Internet host specified in the command.

 Automatic Session Failover

 If a service is available on two or more service nodes and a connec-
 tion to a service fails, the server will attempt to connect the user
 to another service node offering the same service. The user does not
 have to be connected already to that service node. Furthermore, the
 user's context at the time of failure is not automatically restored,
 and login to the new service is required. This feature is supported
 only for LAT connections. Groups

 Every terminal and service node in a LAT network is a member of one
 or more groups, which are specified by a list of numbers from 0 to 255.
 Groups allow an easy means of subdividing the network into what ap-
 pears to be many smaller networks. A terminal user is only aware of
 the services that are offered by nodes in the same group(s).

 The Server Manager can specify the authorized group(s) in which a ter-
 minal is a member. The authorized groups define the set of services
 that the user is allowed to access. In addition, for those nodes that
 implement group codes, a user can further limit access to services by
 disabling some of the authorized groups using a nonprivileged group
 command. The user-settable group codes are a subset of the authorized
 groups.


                                 10

 

 Groups provide a restrictive view of the network. This restricted view
 is mainly for user convenience. Groups apply only to LAT connections.

 Security

 The DECserver 90TL provides functions that enhance security features
 already available in the service nodes. DECserver 90TL security in-
 cludes the ability to lock a terminal's keyboard from other users, op-
 tional login protection, and nonprivileged local mode of operation as
 a default.

 A user can lock the terminal using a lock password. This allows the
 user to leave sessions running at the terminal without fear of secu-
 rity violations. When a terminal is locked, all input from the ter-
 minal is ignored until the lock password is re-entered. The lock fea-
 ture can be disabled by the Server Manager.

 Each terminal port can be set to operate in a secure mode, which causes
 all commands that relate to other users to be disabled for that port.

 Login passwords can be enabled on a per-port basis by the Server Man-
 ager. If enabled, the terminal user must enter a login password to ac-
 cess server functions.

 DECserver 90TL users normally have access to the nonprivileged local
 mode. In this mode, users may only issue commands that affect their
 own terminal environment. The server has a privileged mode for the Server
 Manager's use. The mode is password protected.

 Online HELP Facility

 A full online reference HELP facility is available. The server's HELP
 command provides information on the correct syntax and details about
 each command. In addition, a tutorial HELP feature allows new users
 to learn the basics of DECserver 90TL operation quickly. Tutorial HELP
 can be entered upon logging into the server. Directory Service

 Any DECserver 90TL user can obtain a directory of services available
 to that user with a SHOW SERVICES command. Services for which the user
 is not authorized will not be displayed. Services apply only to LAT
 connections.

                                 11

 

 Permanent Characteristics

 The DECserver 90TL maintains permanent characteristics in nonvolatile
 memory, which is retained even when the power is disconnected. Per-
 manent characteristics are maintained for service and server param-
 eters as well as per-port parameters. Permanent characteristics can
 be reset to factory defaults by pressing the Factory Reset button on
 the hardware unit while the unit is in power up self test.

 Port Characteristics Configuration

 Characteristics governing the operation of an individual port can be
 displayed by a nonprivileged terminal user interactively from the user's
 terminal. Many of the characteristics may be set by the user, but cer-
 tain characteristics are privileged and can only be changed by the Server
 Manager.

 Port parameters that can be set and displayed include: speed, char-
 acter size, group codes, parity, terminal type, access, autobaud, de-
 fault protocol, and password protection.

 Port Access

 A port on a DECserver 90TL can be configured in different ways depend-
 ing on the device attached to the port and its intended use. DECserver
 90TL uses MJ8 connectors as the physical interface. The DECserver 90TL
 utilizes DEC 423-A electrical interface standard for local connections,
 which is compatible with the DEC 232-D interface and supports eight
 asynchronous devices operating at speeds up to 57.6 Kbps with DTR/DSR
 (Data Terminal Ready/Data Terminal Set Ready) signaling.

 Port access is the characteristic that determines how a port can ac-
 cess or be accessed by interactive users and service nodes.

 o  Access Local - Designed for interactive terminals. This allows the
    device (typically an interactive terminal) attached to the port to
    CONNECT to LAT or Telnet.



                                 12

 

 o  Access Remote - Designed for application-driven devices such as asyn-
    chronous printers that are allocated by a service node process. This
    allows the implementation of certain shared printers by multiple
    service nodes.

 o  Access Dynamic - Designed for devices (such as personal computers
    or printers with keyboards) that require both Local and Remote ac-
    cess.

 o  Access None - Designed to allow the Server Manager to disable the
    use of a port.

 With printer support capabilities, the configuration procedure of re-
 mote printers needs to be done once and will be automatically recon-
 figured on system startup. The particular server port must be config-
 ured for remote access and set up to match the characteristics of the
 printer. The system startup command file must be modified to call the
 two command files provided with the service node software. Finally,
 the command files themselves must be customized to reflect the envi-
 ronment of their node. The server can optionally queue remote connects
 if these connects cannot be satisfied immediately. This queue manage-
 ment can be enabled for the server by the Server Manager. Note that
 this is a connection queue only.

 Improved printer sharing allows a printer port on the server to be shared
 among hosts using LAT and hosts using Telnet.

 Terminal Operation

 The DECserver 90TL software supports the simultaneous operation of up
 to eight asynchronous devices at speeds from 75 bps to 57.6 Kbps. The
 software also supports:

 o  Data leads only support

 o  DSR logout

 o  Signal check

 o  Signal control

 o  DSR/DTR flow control

                                 13

 

 o  XON/XOFF flow control

 o  Split speed (transmit and receive) terminal operation

 o  Block Mode transfers up to 2,048 bytes

 o  Automatic line speed detection

 o  Digital personal computer file transfer

 o  Data transparency mode

 o  Ability to pass break character and error notification

 o  Ability to assist in multiple session management via TD/SMP

 Server Management

 Several facilities exist for managing and troubleshooting server op-
 eration. The Server Manager in privileged mode can set up server iden-
 tification information, change port characteristics, or fine tune the
 operating characteristics of the server. Troubleshooting facilities
 include diagnostic tests, a remote console feature, and online statis-
 tics.

 A privileged user can diagnose Ethernet communications problems by loop-
 ing messages to an Ethernet host and through the Ethernet hardware in-
 terface at the server. To diagnose terminal problems, users can ex-
 ecute a command to transmit test data to their terminal, or the Server
 Manager can send test data to any terminal.

 The capability also exists for the Server Manager to test a service
 connection by sending data from the initiating port to the service node
 and back again. The data is then compared and any discrepancies re-
 ported. At the service node, the data can be looped back by the LAT
 protocol, or internally or externally at the service port. This fea-
 ture is supported only by DECserver 90TL service nodes; VAX/VMS ser-
 vice nodes do not support this service loopback capability.


                                 14

 

 The server maintains a variety of statistics and counters. These in-
 clude the following: Ethernet data link statistics, LAT protocol statis-
 tics, and port error statistics. This data can be displayed and ze-
 roed by the Server Manager. Server parameters that can be modified and
 displayed include the server identification, circuit timer, session
 limits, and login limits.

 Internet statistics are also maintained by the server. Internet char-
 acteristics such as Internet address and subnet mask can be modified
 and displayed. IP, ICMP, TCP, IP, UDP, DNS, and SNMP protocol statis-
 tics can be displayed.

 Remote Server Management

 The DECserver 90TL implements the console carrier feature that enables
 access to the DECserver 90TL local mode from either a Telnet host or
 a Phase IV or V DECnet host on the same LAN. With the exception of re-
 mote console port configuration, the entire local mode user interface
 is accessible to the remote console carrier user. This includes the
 privileged commands if the user knows the server's privileged pass-
 word. This capability allows centralized server management and remote
 server diagnosis.

 Communications

 DECserver 90TL software is designed to run on DECserver 90TL hardware
 exclusively, which includes an Ethernet interface for connection to
 an Ethernet transceiver cable.

 The DECserver 90TL hardware has eight MJ8 connectors integral to the
 box. Each port can be individually configured in various modes:

 o  Data leads only

 o  Signal Control

 o  Data leads with DSR logout (if a terminal is powered down the ses-
    sion is automatically disconnected)

 o  Data leads with signal check (checks signal status before and dur-
    ing a session)

                                 15

 

 o  DSR/DTR flow control

 o  Long Break logout

 DECserver 90TL Operation

 The DECserver 90TL ROM-based firmware provides the necessary mainte-
 nance operation protocols for downline loading DECserver 90TL soft-
 ware from a TCP/IP host via BOOTP/TFTP or from a Phase IV or V DECnet
 load host over the Ethernet into server memory. All self-test diag-
 nostics are in DECserver 90TL ROM and are executed on power-up prior
 to downline loading the server. In the event of a bugcheck caused by
 a fatal error, the unit will normally attempt to upline dump server
 memory to the load host. The upline dump is via either BOOTP/TFTP or
 via MOP. Following this, the unit will automatically initialize it-
 self and invoke a downline load.

 DECserver 90TL Configuration and Performance

 The process of configuring the DECserver 90TL is based primarily on
 tradeoffs of cost and performance within the realm of satisfying user
 application requirements. Network applications will range from low-
 speed/low-cost to those of relatively high performance (e.g., connect-
 ing high-speed local terminals to local hosts within a local area net-
 work). The performance of a given server is a function of the expected
 network traffic, the load on hosts to which terminals are connected,
 and resultant processing pursuant to the dedicated function of the unit.
 Thus performance depends on several factors:

 o  Number of terminals

 o  Number of host systems with active connections to the server

 o  Terminal speeds

 o  Terminal user applications

 o  Number and size of host buffers

 o  Terminal workload

                                 16

 

 The DECserver 90TL can sustain an aggregate character throughput of
 30K characters per second.

 In order to achieve a viable configuration, the user and/or a Digi-
 tal software specialist should perform a level of application anal-
 ysis that addresses the factors above. The actual maximum data through-
 put cannot be calculated by multiplying the number of lines by the line
 speed, since many factors already discussed in this section may re-
 duce the actual throughput.

 Restrictions on DECserver 90TL Usage

 While terminal connections using the DECserver 90TL have been designed
 to simulate direct terminal connections as much as possible, a few dif-
 ferences necessarily exist because of the nature of the product. Un-
 der most circumstances, these differences are not noticed by termi-
 nal users or service node application programs. However, applications
 that are directly dependent on the following functions may not oper-
 ate as with a direct connection:

 o  Applications that depend on an extremely fast response time (typ-
    ically less than 200 ms) to operate

 o  Applications that utilize an alternate terminal driver in the ser-
    vice node

 o  Applications that expect incoming connections to have fixed device
    names

 Use of the DECserver 90TL with Modems

 The DECserver 90TL provides DSR and DTR signals that can be used to
 control some modems. The control signals required between a communi-
 cations server and a modem are determined by the modem and, in some
 cases, Telecommunication Utility regulations. To provide satisfactory
 operation, the modem must be configured as follows:

 o  DSR - The modem must assert DSR when it has connected to an open
    telephone line and the modem is ready to establish an outgoing call.
    The modem must de-assert DSR when it is not connected to an open
    telephone line.

                                 17

 

 o  DTR - When DTR is asserted by the server, the modem must be put into
    a state of readiness for receiving an incoming call or the modem
    must be made ready to initiate an outgoing call. When DTR is de-
    asserted, the modem must disconnect from the telephone line and pre-
    vent subsequent connections to the telephone line.

 Modems that cannot be configured in this way are not compatible with
 the DECserver 90TL.

 The DECserver 90TL can operate with a modem that is speed buffering
 only if the modem and server are configured for XON/XOFF flow control
 and the data is non-binary. For binary data communication with a mo-
 dem that is speed buffering and is not configured for XON/XOFF flow
 control, a communications server with CTS/RTS flow control is needed
 (such as the DECserver 700).

 The modems that have been tested with the DECserver 90TL are speci-
 fied in the System Support Addendum (SSA 38.71.03-x).

 Modems Supported

 The DECserver 90TL provides DSR and DTR signals that can be used to
 control some modems. The control signals required between a communi-
 cations server and a modem are determined by the modem and, in some
 cases, Telecommunication Utility regulations. To provide satisfactory
 operation, the modem must be configured as follows:

 o  DSR - The modem must assert DSR when it has connected to an open
    telephone line and the modem is ready to establish an outgoing call.

                                  8

 

    The modem must de-assert DSR when it is not connected to an open
    telephone line.

 o  DTR - When DTR is asserted by the server, the modem must be put into
    a state of readiness for receiving an incoming call or the modem
    must be made ready to initiate an outgoing call. When DTR is de-
    asserted, the modem must disconnect from the telephone line and pre-
    vent subsequent connections to the telephone line.

 Modems that cannot be configured in this way are not compatible with
 the DECserver 90TL.

 The DECserver 90TL can operate with a modem that is speed buffering
 only if the modem and server are configured for XON/XOFF flow control
 and the data is non-binary. For binary data communication with a mo-
 dem that is speed buffering and is not configured for XON/XOFF flow
 control, a communications server with CTS/RTS flow control is needed
 (such as the DECserver 700).

 The following modems have been tested and, when properly configured,
 are compatible with the DECserver 90TL:

 o  DECmodem V32

 o  DF242

 o  DF224

 o  DF212

 Note: This server is not warranted to support modems other than those
 listed. However, modems that support control signaling only with in-
 band signals and/or DSR/DTR can operate with this server for certain
 data communications.
