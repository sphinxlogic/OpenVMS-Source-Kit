 Product Name:  MAILbus 400 Message Router Gateway      SPD 53.65.05
                for OpenVMS, Version 1.2C

 PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

 MAILbus 400[TM] Message Router Gateway (XMR) for OpenVMS[TM] VAX[TM]
 is one of the specialised tools and services required to facilitate
 the migration of users of the DIGITAL[TM] MAILbus[TM] (Message Router)
 based E-Mail systems to MAILbus 400 Message Transfer Agent (MTA) based
 X.400 messaging environment.

 The Gateway is a layered software product that resides on an OpenVMS
 VAX system. XMR provides a direct connection between an X.400 mail sys-
 tem served by a MAILbus 400 Message Transfer Agent (MTA) and a MAIL-
 bus network served by Message Router. It enables MAILbus based appli-
 cations, such as ALL-IN-1[TM] Integrated Office System (IOS), to ex-
 change mail with MAILbus 400 based applications, such as MailWorks[TM]
 Server for UNIX[R].

 The Gateway normally performs address translation between MAILbus and
 O/R addresses using information held in the DIGITAL X.500 Directory
 Service, which is used by the MTA. XMR is also able to deliver a mes-
 sage to a recipient when the originator has supplied, in the recip-
 ient's address, information specific to the receiving mail system; this
 address information being supplied in address attribute extensions avail-
 able to the sending system. If this information is not supplied, the
 Gateway will use the supplied address information to search the DIG-
 ITAL X.500 Directory Service for the address translation for the re-
 ceiving mail system. If XMR is unable to find a translation, the mes-
 sage will be non-delivered. When the Gateway is processing non-actionable

                                                          April 1999

                                                         AE-Q8QTF-TE

 

 addresses, if a translation is not found in the Directory, the Gate-
 way will generate a repliable address based on the Gateway's own ad-
 dress.

 The Gateway maps bodypart contents between the outbound bodypart type
 and the associated type in the receiving system. The mapping is based
 on a bodypart mapping table, which is customisable to allow the pre-
 ferred mappings to be modified, or added to, according to the types
 present in the mail system. XMR does not perform any conversion of the
 actual content data. MAILbus bodyparts with contents such as WPS-PLUS[TM],
 DECdx[TM], RMS (tagged as DDIF[TM]) or a PC format (for example, Word-
 Perfect[TM] or Microsoft[R] Word) are transferred to the MAILbus 400
 MTA as tagged Externally Defined bodyparts. Conversions are initiated
 by the MTA, which calls the appropriate CDA[TM] converter library, if
 required. In the reverse direction, the X.400 bodyparts are mapped into
 MAILbus bodyparts and tagged so that the appropriate viewer or con-
 verter can be automatically invoked by the receiving user agent or gate-
 way.

 The Gateway communicates with the MAILbus 400 MTA using the X/Open[TM]
 XAPI interface, allowing access to all the features of the X.400 stan-
 dard. XMR communicates only with the MAILbus 400 MTA and not X.400 MTAs
 from other vendors. The Gateway communicates with Message Router us-
 ing the Message Router interface as documented in the Message Router
 Programmer's Kit. The Gateway may be located either remotely or lo-
 cally to Message Router. The Gateway may be located either remotely
 or locally to the MAILbus 400 MTA but where it is necessary to have
 the MAILbus 400 MTA convert WPS-PLUS, DECdx or DDIF bodyparts received
 from the Gateway, the Gateway and the MAILbus 400 MTA should be colo-
 cated on the same OpenVMS VAX node.

 The Compound Document Architecture (CDA) Converter Library is required
 for the MAILbus 400 MTA to convert the content of Message Router WPS-PLUS
 bodyparts, from ALL-IN-1 IOS, and DECdx bodyparts (for example, from
 the Message Router/S Gateway (MRS) and the Message Router/P Gateway





                                  2

 

 (MRP)) to an X.400 bodypart type; the required CDA converter is cur-
 rently only available on OpenVMS VAX. The DEC[TM] ODA Compound Doc-
 ument Architecture Gateway is required for the MAILbus 400 MTA to con-
 vert the content of Message Router RMS bodyparts when they contain DDIF
 data.

 To communicate with MAILbus and MAILbus 400 environments, the Gate-
 way uses DECnet[TM]-Plus for OpenVMS (formerly DECnet/OSI[R] for Open-
 VMS) and DIGITAL X.500 Directory Service for directory services.

 Management

 XMR is managed according to the DIGITAL model Enterprise Management
 Architecture (EMA), in the same way as the MAILbus 400 MTA. It can be
 managed from any DECnet-Plus node equipped with a suitable Director,
 such as NCL.

 Conformance to Standards

 The Gateway communicates with the MAILbus 400 MTA using the X/Open XAPI
 interface which is conformant to the X/Open CAE Specifications.

 YEAR 2000 COMPLIANCE (Y2K)

 MAILbus 400 Message Router Gateway also becomes Year 2000 Ready with
 its Version 1.2B release.Any two digit dates received by the Gateway
 are interpreted as follows:

 -  Years "81" to "99" (inclusive) as "1981" to "1999" and

 -  Years "00" to "80" (inclusive) as "2000" to "2080"

 MAILbus 400 Message Router Gateway is specified as Year 2000 Ready and
 will correctly process, calculate, compare and sequence date data from,
 into and between the twentieth and the twenty-first centuries and the
 years 1999 and 2000, including leap year calculations, when used in
 accordance with the associated DIGITAL Product documentation and pro-
 vided that all hardware, firmware and software used in combination with


                                  3

 

 such DIGITAL Products properly exchange date data with the DIGITAL Prod-
 ucts.
