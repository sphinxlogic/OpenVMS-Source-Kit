 PRODUCT NAME:  DECserver 700 for VMS[*], ULTRIX,       SPD 38.73.04
                UNIX[R], and MS-DOS[R], Version 1.1c

 DESCRIPTION

 DECserver 700 for VMS, ULTRIX, UNIX, and MS-DOS, Version 1.1c is the
 software release for DECserver 700.

 The DECserver 700 software provides concurrent Local Area Transport
 (LAT) and Telnet TCP/IP protocol support from a DECserver 700 commu-
 nications server to enable connectivity to host systems that utilize
 LAT or TCP/IP protocols. The TCP/IP protocol suite is used to connect
 to UNIX host systems and other host systems that support the TCP/IP
 protocol suite.

 The DECserver 700 Communications Server is an Ethernet Communications
 Server for Ethernet Local Area Networks (LANs). The DECserver 700 pro-
 vides a convenient method to logically connect up to sixteen asynchronous
 terminals to one or more service nodes (hosts) on an Ethernet. Once
 the terminal is connected, a user can utilize application programs and
 utilities as though the terminal is directly connected to a host. Thus,
 it may be possible to utilize the DECserver 700 to connect all ter-
 minals to service nodes in place of traditional interfaces, except for
 host console terminals.

 The DECserver 700 is available in two models, the DECserver 700-16 and
 the DECserver 700-08. The DECserver 700-16 provides attachment for six-
 teen asynchronous devices via MJ8 connectors (also referred to as RJ45
 connectors). The DECserver 700-16 conforms to the DEC423 electrical
 interface standard for local connections, and supports two user se-
 lectable modem signaling options: CTS/RTS/DSR/DTR or RI/DCD/DSRS/DTR.
 DEC423 is a superset of EIA-423-A/CCITT V1.0 with some exceptions, and

 supports longer cable runs and higher signaling speeds. The DECserver
 700-08 provides attachment for eight asynchronous devices via DB25 con-
 nectors. Both DECserver 700 models support asynchronous devices with
 interfaces that conform to EIA/TIA-232-3/CCITT V.24/V.28.

 The DECserver 700 supports connections to wide area networks (WANs)
 via modems. The DECserver 700 also allows for host-initiated connec-
 tions to serial printers. A serial printer can be shared between LAT
 print requests and Telnet requests. Telnet requests cannot be queued
 on the server. A print symbiont on service nodes can initiate connec-
 tions to serial printers connected to DECserver 700 ports. This al-
 lows the printers to be distributed throughout a facility and accessed
 transparently by service node users. Incoming host-initiated connect
 requests may be queued FIFO at the server.

 Port-to-port connections on the same server are also supported.

 In addition, the DECserver 700 provides IP end-node routing via SLIP
 (Serial Line Internet Protocol). Up to 16 TCP/IP systems can be con-
 nected to the serial ports of the DECserver 700. These systems can run
 IP applications (such as Telnet, FTP[R], X-Windows, etc.) on the se-
 rial line and communicate with other TCP/IP services on the network.

 The DECserver 700 supports reverse LAT and Telnet Listener. Both fa-
 cilities are provided to enable a network node, such as a host sys-
 tem, to connect to a DECserver port. This facility could be used to
 support printers, a modem pool for outgoing calls, and connection to
 the asynchronous ports of a system without other network access of other
 types of devices that have an asynchronous interface.

 Both reverse LAT and Telnet Listener provide the ability to group phys-
 ical ports into logical groupings. For example, a group of ports con-
 nected to the asynchronous interfaces of the same system could be grouped
 so a connect request would be routed to any of the currently unused
 ports. A logical grouping can contain any number of ports from one to
 all the ports on the server.

 The DECserver 700 implements the LAT protocol for communication with
 service nodes that implement this protocol on the same Ethernet. This
 interface has been optimized for high terminal I/O performance over
 an Ethernet, while reducing host CPU cycles required to handle inter-
 rupts. Under most I/O loading conditions, a significant performance
 gain may be realized by using the DECserver 700 versus direct termi-
 nal connections via traditional asynchronous backplane communications
 interfaces.

 The DECserver 700 also implements the TCP/IP protocol suite for com-
 munication with host systems that implement TCP/IP. The TCP/IP pro-
 tocols are based on the University of California's 4.3 Berkeley Soft-
 ware Distribution (BSD). The following TCP/IP protocols are supported
 and adhere to the Defense Data Network (DDN) Request for Comments:

 o  Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is the Internet-standard, transport-
    level protocol that provides the reliable, end-to-end full duplex
    stream service that supports many application protocols (RFC 793).

 o  User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is an Internet protocol that provides
    datagram service to application programs, allowing an application
    program on one machine to send a datagram to an application pro-
    gram on another machine. UDP is necessary for the Domain[R] Name
    System and the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) (RFC 768).

 o  Internet Protocol (IP) is an Internet-standard protocol that de-
    fines the Internet datagram as the unit of information that is passed
    across the Internet, and provides the universal addressing scheme
    for hosts and gateways for Internet connectionless, best-effort packet
    delivery services. IP includes ICMP as an integral part (RFC 791).

 o  Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) is an Internet network pro-
    tocol that specifies error and control messages used with the In-
    ternet protocols (RFC 792).

 o  Packet Internet Groper (PING) tests the reachability of nodes on
    the users' Internet. ICMP echoes requests are sent and replies pro-
    cessed.


                                  3

 

 o  Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) is an Internet protocol used to
    perform dynamic address resolution to dynamically map or translate
    an Internet address into the correct physical hardware address (RFC
    826).

 o  Telnet is the standard Internet application-level protocol for re-
    mote terminal connection service. Telnet is a virtual terminal fa-
    cility that allows a user at one site to establish a TCP connec-
    tion to a remote system. Telnet makes the local terminal appear as
    a direct extension of the remote system, allowing the user to con-
    duct a session and run application programs as if the user's ter-
    minal was directly connected to the remote system (RFC 854).

    Both Telnet client and server capabilities are provided:

    -  Telnet client provides the ability to connect to any remote TCP
       port at an Internet address on a local area network or a wide
       area network. Telnet client allows the user to specify a remote
       computer by Internet address as well as by Domain name.

    -  Telnet server provides the ability to accept connection requests
       from Internet hosts on a LAN or WAN to DECserver 700 ports, such
       as printers, host systems, or other serial devices.

    -  Telnet character and binary profiles are supported for Inter-
       net sessions. Telnet options supported include: status (RFC 859),
       end of record (RFC 885), remote flow control (RFC 1080), echo
       (RFC 857), timing mark (RFC 860), binary (RFC 856), and suppress
       go ahead (RFC 858).

    -  Telnet Remote Console allows a user to establish a remote Tel-
       net connection to the management port on the terminal server and
       manage the server as if locally attached. The Telnet Listener
       23 can now be assigned to any terminal server port as well as
       the remote console. Any Telnet Listener (23, 2001-20016) can be
       assigned to be the remote console.




                                  4

 

 o  Internet Domain Name System (DNS) Support - The Domain Name Sys-
    tem provides the translation from system name to Internet address.
    The DECserver 700 will interface to user programs and send queries
    to Domain name servers for translating Domain names to Internet ad-
    dresses, and Internet addresses to Domain names (RFCs 1034, 1035).

 o  Subnet Addressing (RFC 950).

 o  Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) -- The SNMP agent allows
    the DECserver 700 to be managed by an SNMP network management sys-
    tem. Retrieving information from the terminal server is possible
    using the SNMP GET and GET-NEXT requests. The SNMP SET operation
    is fully supported, providing the ability to modify DECserver pa-
    rameters as well as create and delete applicable table entries. The
    terminal server can send unsolicited event alarms to specified SNMP
    management stations via the SNMP TRAP message. Terminal server vari-
    ables accessible via SNMP (RFC 1157), not a MIB, are defined by the
    Internet documents: MIB II (RFC 1213), RS232-like MIB (RFC 1317),
    the Character MIB (RFC 1316).

 o  Serial Line Internet Protocol (SLIP) - A host computer that sup-
    ports SLIP can use the DECserver 700 serial port as its network con-
    nection. This gives IP end nodes, which have no Ethernet controller,
    access to the network and to other serial-line attached TCP/IP end
    nodes. Any IP application can then be run over the SLIP link (RFC
    1055).

 o  Bootp (RFC 951 and RFC 1084) and tftp (RFC 783) together provide
    a method for downloading the DECserver 700 from any host that sup-
    ports those protocols. Bootp provides a mechanism by which the server
    can identify a host from which it can request a download. Tftp pro-
    vides the data transfer facility used to copy to software from the
    load host to the server.

 The DECserver 700 also implements and supports the Terminal Device/Session
 Management Protocol (TD/SMP) to manage multiple sessions at the de-
 vice level. The DECserver 700 provides the ability to communicate with
 devices which also implement this protocol, and assist in the manage-
 ment of multiple sessions for these devices. By implementing this pro-
 tocol, the DECserver 700 can permit attached devices to maintain screen

                                  5

 

 and keyboard context for multiple LAT and/or Telnet sessions, as well
 as allow these devices to run multiple LAT and/or Telnet sessions con-
 currently.

 The DECserver 700-8 will support block mode transfers of up to 2,048
 bytes, and the DECserver 700-16 will support block mode transfers of
 up to 512 bytes, or with a memory (SIM) upgrade to 2 megabytes (or more).
 The DECserver 700-16 will support block mode transfers up to 2,048 bytes.

 The DECserver 700 implements the ODL (On Demand Loading) font load-
 ing protocol which allows Asian terminals that implement the ODL pro-
 tocol to communicate with a VMS host via a terminal server. The Asian
 terminals will be able to request font definitions from a VMS host when
 connected to a DECserver 700. This feature is supported only for LAT
 connections.

 Software that runs on the DECserver 700 is downline loaded over the
 network from a Phase IV or V DECnet load host. Software that runs on
 DECserver 700 can also be downloaded from any system that supports the
 Bootp and tftp protocols. Terminal access using the DECserver 700 does
 not require DECnet running in the same service node; LAT uses the Eth-
 ernet addressing mechanism to transport terminal messages.

 Features such as login load balancing, multiple terminal sessions, au-
 tomatic failover, and remote printer support can lead to greater user
 productivity.

 For wide area network communications, terminal users can connect to
 remote hosts via Telnet through a TCP/IP router or gateway. In addi-
 tion, terminal users can connect to a local service node running DEC-
 net, where they can "SET HOST" to a remote system via the DECnet net-
 work terminal protocol. If this system has the requisite X.25 or SNA
 3270 access routines, a terminal user could communicate to a remote
 SNA or X.25 host through the appropriate gateway and this interven-
 ing host. A DECserver 700 terminal user cannot communicate directly
 to remote hosts through DECnet Routers or X.25/SNA Gateways. Wide area
 network traffic will not provide the same high level of performance
 as local terminal connections due to the additional DECnet or Inter-
 net protocol overhead.

 Features

 Terminal Connection Management

 Through the use of a simple command, users can establish a logical con-
 nection, called a session, to any service node that implements the LAT
 or Telnet protocol on the same Ethernet LAN, or to a remote host that
 implements the TCP/IP protocol suite. This connection makes the ter-
 minal appear physically connected to the service node, and the ter-
 minal user can use standard system utilities and applications supported
 by that node. Each terminal connected to the server can connect to the
 same or a different service node on the Ethernet. Furthermore, sev-
 eral servers can be used to connect many terminals to one or more ser-
 vice nodes.

 A service node can have one or more LAT services that are offered to
 DECserver 700 users. Services and nodes are identified by name. Users
 always connect to services, not to nodes; often one of the service names
 will be the node name. Users of Telnet connect to nodes.

 In a VAXcluster environment, the DECserver 700 users of LAT see each
 VAXcluster on the Ethernet as a collection of service nodes offering
 a common service. Each cluster node may also offer a service whose name
 is equivalent to its node name. In this case, a terminal user can con-
 nect either to the cluster service or a service associated with a par-
 ticular cluster node. To connect via Telnet, a user must specify the
 specific cluster node to which to connect.

 Load Balancing

 When a connection is made to a service, the actual node for the con-
 nection is determined by load balancing. Load balancing is a process
 the server uses when more than one node offers the same service. Ser-
 vice nodes do not have to be configured in a cluster for load balanc-
 ing to be used. Service nodes with the same names may be running dif-
 ferent operating systems. Using the load balancing process, the server



                                  7

 

 connects to the node with the highest rating for the service desired.
 This rating is based on the current loading on the nodes that offer
 the service.

 This feature is supported only for LAT connections.

 Multiple Sessions

 The DECserver 700 allows each user to establish and maintain up to eight
 sessions to one or more service nodes. Only one session per user can
 be active at a time. Through simple switching commands, the user can
 access the different sessions without repeating a login dialogue each
 time. Some operating systems may impose limits on the number of LAT
 or Telnet sessions that a host will support.


 Multiple Session Management

 The DECserver 700 server allows direct communication with devices that
 support the TD/SMP protocol. This protocol provides the ability for
 the attached device to maintain screen and keyboard context for the
 multiple LAT or Telnet sessions that the DECserver 700 provides. By
 implementing the ability to directly communicate with this protocol
 to the attached device, the DECserver 700 can now assist in the man-
 agement of context of these multiple sessions, as well as allow for
 simultaneous output to multiple LAT or Telnet sessions being maintained
 by the device.


 Outbound Connection Queues

 If a terminal user requests a connection to a server and the requested
 service is currently in use, the terminal server users may opt to have
 the requested connection queued to the remote service. If the user's






                                  8

 

 port has been appropriately configured, this feature happens automat-
 ically whenever a connection fails for this reason. The connection re-
 quest is queued at the service node end and is processed first-in/first-
 out (FIFO) until such time as the user's connection request can be com-
 pleted. This feature assists in the fair management of limited net-
 work resources. Once queued for connection, the user also has the op-
 tion to cancel the queue entry and proceed with other sessions. This
 feature is supported only for LAT connections.

 Command Line Recall and Editing

 The DECserver 700 server supports multiple command line entry recall
 and editing.


 Welcome Identification

 The DECserver 700 server-standard welcome banner, which includes ter-
 minal server type, version number, internal base level, and protocol
 version number, is issued whenever a user successfully logs in to the
 server. The server will also print a Server-Manager-settable identi-
 fication string. This can be useful for automatic server identifica-
 tion or for small daily messages used for communication with the ter-
 minal server users.

 Local Mode and Service Mode

 For the most part, the environment provided by the DECserver 700 is
 identical to the environment the user would experience if attached di-
 rectly to the service node. When operating in this mode, the user is
 said to be in Service Mode. Occasionally, such as during connection
 establishment, the user interacts directly with the DECserver 700. When
 operating in this mode, the user is in Local Mode.

 In Local Mode, the terminal input is interpreted directly by DECserver
 700 as commands to be performed by the server.




                                  9

 

 Additional commands and displays to support the features available with
 the TD/SMP protocol are usable in Local Mode. These commands will be
 used to enable or disable server recognition of the TD/SMP commands.

 Local Mode has three different levels of privilege: privileged, non-
 privileged, and secure. Privileged mode is provided for the Server Man-
 ager to control the environment of the server and the terminal users.
 Access to this mode is password protected. Nonprivileged commands al-
 low the terminal user to control their service sessions, set the ter-
 minal characteristics and show server information. The Server Manager
 can set the server to secure mode on a per-terminal basis, which fur-
 ther limits the commands users can enter to only those which directly
 relate to the user's own terminal.

 The Server Manager environment is a logical extension of the user en-
 vironment. The Server Manager is treated as a server user with a priv-
 ileged status. The Server Manager sets a terminal to this status us-
 ing a command which requires a password. This privileged status al-
 lows the Server Manager to enter commands not usually available to server
 users. These commands set server characteristics, provide control over
 server port usage, and provide the ability to control the user's ac-
 cess to the server and network services.

 In Service Mode, the terminal input is passed directly to the connected
 service node with several exceptions. One exception, called the lo-
 cal switch character, allows the user to enter Local Mode from Ser-
 vice Mode. The [BREAK] key may also be used for this function. Other
 exceptions, called the forward and backward switch characters, allow
 the user to switch between sessions without the need to enter local
 mode. The switch characters are disabled by default but may be enabled
 by command. Both CTRL/S and CTRL/Q are usually interpreted locally,
 but flow control using these characters can be disabled.

 Autoconnection

 Autoconnection is a function that automatically connects a user ter-
 minal to a service node when connection failures occur or upon user
 login to the server. In conjunction with this function, a dedicated
 or preferred service can be specified for each terminal user.

                                 10

 

 If a dedicated service is specified, the DECserver 700 will attempt
 to connect to that service when a character is typed on the terminal
 keyboard or when an existing connection fails. In dedicated service
 mode, only one session is available. As this mode is designed to sim-
 ulate a direct terminal connection, no local mode commands or messages
 are available to the terminal user. Ports with dedicated service can
 be automatically logged out of the server when the user logs out of
 the service node.

 If a preferred service is specified, the DECserver 700 will attempt
 to connect to that service as with the dedicated service mode of op-
 eration. However, the terminal user can enter local mode and estab-
 lish other sessions.

 Automatic Protocol Selection

 It is possible to automatically connect to an Internet host or LAT ser-
 vice without explicitly identifying the connection as LAT or Telnet.
 If the port is configured with a value for the default protocol as "ANY",
 the server will attempt a LAT connection first to the name specified
 in the LAT service field. If the service is not available or unknown,
 the terminal server will then automatically attempt a Telnet connec-
 tion to the Internet host specified in the command.


 Automatic Session Failover

 If a service is available on two or more service nodes and a connec-
 tion to a service fails, the server will attempt to connect the user
 to another service node offering the same service. The user does not
 have to be connected to that service node. Furthermore, the user's con-
 text at the time of failure is not automatically restored and login
 to the new service is required. This feature is supported only for LAT
 connections.


 Groups



                                 11

 

 Every terminal and service node in a LAT network is a member of one
 or more groups specified by a list of numbers from 0 to 255. Groups
 allow an easy means of subdividing the network into what appears to
 be many smaller networks. A terminal user is only aware of the ser-
 vices that are offered by nodes in the same group(s).

 The Server Manager can specify the authorized group(s) in which a ter-
 minal is a member. The authorized groups define the set of services
 that the user is allowed to access. In addition, for those nodes that
 implement group codes, a user can further limit access to services by
 disabling some of the authorized groups using a nonprivileged group
 command. The user-settable group codes are a subset of the authorized
 groups.

 Groups provide a restrictive view of the network. This restricted view
 is mainly for user convenience. Groups apply only to LAT connections.

 Security

 The DECserver 700 provides functions that enhance security features
 already available in the service nodes. DECserver 700 security includes
 the ability to lock a terminal's keyboard from other users, optional
 login protection, and nonprivileged local mode of operation as a de-
 fault.

 A user may lock the terminal using a lock password. This allows the
 user to leave sessions running at the terminal without fear of secu-
 rity violations. When a terminal is locked, all input from the ter-
 minal is ignored until the lock password is re-entered. The lock fea-
 ture may be disabled by the Server Manager.

 Each terminal port can be set to operate in a secure mode, which causes
 all commands that relate to other users to be disabled for that port.

 Login passwords can be enabled on a per-server basis by the Server Man-
 ager. If enabled, the terminal user must enter a login password to ac-
 cess server functions.



                                 12

 

 DECserver 700 users usually have access to the nonprivileged local mode.
 In this mode, users may only issue commands that affect their own ter-
 minal environment. The server has a privileged mode for Server Man-
 ager's use. The mode is password protected.

 Online HELP Facility

 A full online reference HELP facility is available. The server's HELP
 command provides information on the correct syntax and details about
 each command. In addition, a tutorial HELP feature allows new users
 to quickly learn the basics of DECserver 700 operation. Tutorial HELP
 may be entered upon logging into the server. HELP is also based on whether
 the user is secure, nonprivileged, or privileged.

 Directory Service

 Any DECserver 700 user can obtain a directory of LAT services avail-
 able to that user with a SHOW SERVICES command. Services for which the
 user is not authorized will not be displayed. Services apply only to
 LAT connections.


 Permanent Characteristics

 The DECserver 700 maintains permanent characteristics in non-volatile
 memory, which is retained even when the power is disconnected. Per-
 manent characteristics are maintained for service and server param-
 eters as well as per-port parameters. Permanent characteristics can
 be reset to factory defaults by pressing the software reset button on
 the hardware unit while plugging in the power cord.


 Port Characteristics Configuration







                                 13

 

 Characteristics governing the operation of an individual port can be
 displayed by a nonprivileged terminal user interactively from the user's
 terminal. Many of the characteristics may be set by the user, but cer-
 tain characteristics are privileged and may only be changed by the Server
 Manager.

 Port parameters that can be set and displayed include: speed, char-
 acter size, group codes, parity, terminal type, access, autobaud, de-
 fault protocol, and password protection.

 Port Access

 A port on a DECserver 700 may be configured in different ways depend-
 ing on the device attached to the port and its intended use. DECserver
 700-16 provides sixteen MJ8 connectors as the physical interface, and
 they conform to the DEC423 electrical interface standard for local con-
 nections, as well as provide two user selectable model signaling op-
 tions: CTS/RTS/DSR/DTR or RI/DCD/DSRS/DTR. The DECserver 700-08 pro-
 vides eight DB25 male connectors as the physical interface. Both DEC-
 server 700 models support asynchronous devices with interfaces that
 conform to EIA/TIA-232-E/CCITT V.24/V.28 and speeds up to 115.2 Kbps.

 Port access is the characteristic which determines how a port may ac-
 cess or be accessed by interactive users and service nodes.

 o  Access Local - Designed for interactive terminals. This allows the
    device (typically an interactive terminal) attached to the port to
    CONNECT to LAT or Telnet. Additional example: dial-in modem.

 o  Access Remote - Designed for application-driven devices such as asyn-
    chronous printers which are allocated by a service node process.
    This allows the implementation of certain shared printers by mul-
    tiple service nodes. Additional example: dial-out modem.

 o  Access Dynamic - Designed for devices (such as personal computers
    or printers with keyboards) which require both Local and Remote ac-
    cess. Additional example: dial-in/dial-out modem.



                                 14

 

 o  Access None - Designed to allow the Server Manager to disable the
    use of a port.

 With printer support capabilities, the configuration procedure of re-
 mote printers needs to be done once and will be automatically recon-
 figured on system startup. The particular server port must be config-
 ured for remote access and set up to match the characteristics of the
 printer.

 Terminal Operation

 The DECserver 700 software supports the simultaneous operation of up
 to 16 asynchronous devices at speeds from 75 bps to 115.2 Kbps. The
 software also supports:

 o  Data leads only support

 o  Modem control (DS700-08 only)

 o  Signal control with Signal Select (DS700-16 only)

 o  DSR logout

 o  Long Break logout

 o  Signal check

 o  CTS/RTS flow control

 o  DSR/DTR flow control

 o  XON/XOFF flow control

 o  Split speed (transmit and receive) terminal operation

 o  Modem Fallback Features (DS700-08 only)

 o  Block Mode transfers up to 2,048 bytes (DS700-08 and DS700-16 with
    memory upgrade to 2 MB or more). (* See note below.)

 o  Digital personal computer file transfer

 o  Automatic line speed detection

                                 15

 

 o  Data transparency mode

 o  Ability to pass break character and error notification

 o  Ability to assist in multiple session management via TD/SMP

 o  RI simulation for DTEs that require it

 *  NOTE: The DECserver 700-8 will support block mode transfers of up
    to 2,048 bytes with 1 or more Megabytes of memory. The DECserver
    700-16 will support block mode transfer of up to 512 bytes in 1 Megabyte
    or up to 2,048 bytes with 2 or more Megabytes of memory.

 Server Management

 Several facilities exist for managing and troubleshooting server op-
 eration. The Server Manager in privileged mode can set up server iden-
 tification information, change port characteristics, or fine tune the
 operating characteristics of the server. Troubleshooting facilities
 include diagnostic tests, a remote console feature, and online statis-
 tics.

 A privileged user can diagnose Ethernet communications problems by loop-
 ing messages to an Ethernet host and through the Ethernet hardware in-
 terface at the server. To diagnose terminal problems, users can ex-
 ecute a command to transmit test data to their terminal, or the Server
 Manager can send test data to any terminal.

 The capability also exists for the Server Manager to test a service
 connection by sending data from the initiating port to the service node
 and back again. The data is then compared and any discrepancies re-
 ported. At the service node, the data can be looped back by the LAT
 protocol or internally or externally at the service port. This fea-
 ture is supported only by DECserver 700 service nodes; VMS service nodes
 do not support this service loopback capability.

 The server maintains a variety of statistics and counters. These in-
 clude the following: Ethernet data link statistics, LAT protocol statis-
 tics, and port error statistics. This data can be displayed and ze-
 roed by the Server Manager. Server parameters that can be modified and
 displayed include the server identification, circuit timer, session
 limits, and login limits.

 Internet statistics are also maintained by the server. Internet char-
 acteristics such as Internet address and subnet mask can be modified
 and displayed. IP, ICMP, TCP, IP, UDP, DNS, and SNMP protocol statis-
 tics can be displayed.

 Remote Server Management

 The DECserver 700 implements the console carrier feature which enables
 access to the DECserver 700 local mode from a Phase IV or V DECnet host
 on the same LAN. With the exception of remote console port configu-
 ration, the entire local mode user interface is accessible to the re-
 mote console carrier user. This includes the privileged commands if
 the user knows the server's privileged password. This capability al-
 lows centralized server management and remote server diagnosis.

 The Telnet Remote Console feature is also available as stated above.


 Communications

 DECserver 700 software is designed to run on DECserver 700 hardware
 exclusively, which includes an Ethernet interface for connection to
 an Ethernet transceiver cable.

 The DECserver 700-16 hardware has sixteen MJ8 connectors integral to
 the box. The DECserver 700-08 hardware has eight DB25 male connectors
 integral to the box. Each port can be individually configured in var-
 ious modes:

 o  Modem Control (DS700-08 only)

 o  Signal Control with Signal Select (DS700-16 only)

                                 17

 

 o  Data leads with DSR logout (if a terminal is powered down the ses-
    sion is automatically disconnected)

 o  Data leads with signal check (checks signal status before and dur-
    ing a session)

 o  DSR/DTR flow control

 o  CTS/RTS flow control

 o  XON/XOFF flow control

 o  Long Break logout

 o  Modem Fallback Feature

 o  RI simulation for DTEs that require it

 DECserver 700 Operation

 The DECserver 700 ROM-based firmware provides the necessary mainte-
 nance operation protocols for downline loading DECserver 700 software
 from a Phase IV or V DECnet load host over the Ethernet into server
 memory and bootp and HTP to load from a system that supports those pro-
 tocols also. All self-test diagnostics are in DECserver 700 ROM and
 are executed on power-up prior to downline loading the server. In the
 event of a bugcheck caused by a fatal error, the unit will usually at-
 tempt to upline dump server memory to a DECnet Phase IV or V load host.
 Following this, the unit will automatically initialize itself and in-
 voke a downline load.

 DECserver 700 Configuration and Performance

 The performance of a given server is a function of the expected net-
 work traffic, the load on hosts to which terminals are connected, and
 resultant processing pursuant to the dedicated function of the unit.
 Thus performance depends on several factors:

 o  Number of terminals

 o  Number of host systems with active connections to the server

                                 18

 

 o  Terminal speeds

 o  Terminal user applications

 o  Number and size of host buffers

 o  Terminal workload

 o  LAT circuit timer

 The DECserver 700-16 can sustain an aggregate character throughput of
 215,000 characters per second. The DECserver 700-08 can sustain an ag-
 gregate character throughput of 120,000 characters per second. In or-
 der to achieve a viable configuration, the user and/or a Digital soft-
 ware specialist should perform a level of application analysis which
 addresses the factors above. The actual maximum data throughput can-
 not be calculated by multiplying the number of lines by the line speed,
 since many factors already discussed in this section may reduce the
 actual throughput.

 Restrictions on DECserver 700 Usage

 While terminal connections using the DECserver 700 have been designed
 to simulate direct terminal connections as much as possible, a few dif-
 ferences necessarily exist because of the nature of the product. Un-
 der most circumstances, these differences are not noticed by termi-
 nal users or service node application programs. However, applications
 which are directly dependent on the following functions may not op-
 erate as with a direct connection:

 o  Applications that depend on reading or setting the terminal speed,
    character size, and parity by manipulating system data structures

 o  Applications that depend on an extremely fast response time (typ-
    ically less than 200 ms) to operate

 o  Applications that utilize an alternate terminal driver in the ser-
    vice node


                                 19

 

 o  Applications that expect incoming connections to have fixed device
    names
