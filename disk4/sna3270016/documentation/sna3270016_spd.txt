          PRODUCT NAME:  Compaq SNA 3270 Data Stream             SPD 26.87.09
                         Programming Interface for OpenVMS, Ver-
                         sion 1.6

          This SPD describes Compaq SNA 3270 Data Stream Programming Interface
          for OpenVMS, which is available for the OpenVMS Alpha and OpenVMS VAX
          platforms. All information applies to both platforms unless otherwise
          indicated.

          DESCRIPTION

          Compaq SNA 3270 Data Stream Programming Interface for OpenVMS (3270
          DS) is a layered software product that allows user-written applica-
          tions running on suitably configured OpenVMS systems within a DECnet
          or TCP/IP network or on suitably configured OpenVMS systems within an
          OpenVMS SNA environment to exchange messages with cooperating appli-
          cations on an IBM host. The 3270 DS software exists in the OpenVMS sys-
          tem as a shareable image. Access between the cooperating Compaq and
          IBM applications is via one of the following SNA servers or gateways:

          TCP/IP or DECnet Connections

          o  Compaq SNA Peer Server

          o  Compaq SNA Domain Gateway

          o  Compaq SNA Access Server for Windows NT

          o  Compaq SNA Server for OpenVMS Alpha, a layered product that sup-
             ports local access as well as TCP/IP and DECnet clients

          DECnet Only Connections

          o  Compaq DECnet SNA Gateway for Synchronous Transport

          o  Compaq DECnet SNA Gateway for Channel Transport

                                                                   April 2001

 



          Compaq SNA 3270 Data Stream                           SPD 26.87.09
          Programming Interface for OpenVMS, Version 1.6

          o  Compaq SNA Server for OpenVMS VAX, an OpenVMS VAX layered product
             that supports local access as well as remote DECnet clients

          The 3270 DS programming interface is a collection of subroutines that
          provides an easy-to-use interface for the SNA server or gateway ap-
          plication programmer who has a specific need to interface to an IBM
          application subsystem that uses the LU type 2 (LU2) protocol. The prod-
          uct can be used with many types of applications. As an example, a cus-
          tomized 3270 terminal emulator application can be written by a user
          and layered on top of 3270 DS. Applications can be event driven or syn-
          chronous in nature with no loss in available functions.

          Features

          The 3270 DS product is designed to insulate the OpenVMS application
          programmer from the inner workings of the SNA network environment as
          much as possible, thus allowing the user to concentrate on solving the
          application problem. The product performs the following SNA functions
          on the user's behalf:

          o  Receives and interprets the bind

          o  Accepts the bind and starts the session

          o  Maintains the state machines for chaining, bracketing, and data flow
             control

          o  Processes an Unbind Type 2 automatically

          o  Allows, on supported SNA servers and gateways, secured Logical Unit
             (LU) access via the SNA3270$REQUEST_CONNECT procedure call.

          As a result, the OpenVMS user is required to perform a minimum of SNA
          functions, including processing the CLEAR and CANCEL functions and han-
          dling contention.

          This product is a set of subroutines used to perform such functions
          as establishing sessions, sending data, receiving data, and discon-
          necting sessions. In addition, the 3270 DS interface may be used to
          interpret the 3270 data stream and build a screen image. The OpenVMS
          application is then free to interact with the screen image.

          Compaq SNA 3270 Data Stream                           SPD 26.87.09
          Programming Interface for OpenVMS, Version 1.6

          The 3270 DS product allows two modes of connection: Data Stream Mode
          and Field Mode.

          Data Stream Mode

          Data Stream Mode provides a means to send and receive uninterpreted
          3270 data streams as defined by IBM. In this mode, the interface per-
          forms all SNA-specific functions. For example, the OpenVMS applica-
          tion is not required to handle chaining, brackets, RUs, or RHs. At the
          same time, this mode allows the interface to provide the OpenVMS ap-
          plication with the complete 3270 data stream. It is the OpenVMS user's
          responsibility to interpret the outbound data stream for 3270 orders
          and commands, and to build and manipulate a screen image (if desired).
          Similarly, it is the OpenVMS user's responsibility to build the in-
          bound data stream from the user's own screen image or from some other
          data structure.

          An OpenVMS application that needs to use extended attributes must use
          a Data Stream Mode connection. Extended attributes are extensions to
          the basic field attributes, namely:

          o  Extended highlighting (blink, reverse video, underscore)

          o  Color

          o  Programmed symbols (selectable symbol set)

          o  Screen partitions and windows

          Field Mode

          Field Mode performs a presentation service to provide a screen image
          interface. The screen image may be read field by field, or accessed
          directly. The interface interprets 3270 commands and orders in an out-
          bound data stream to build the screen. In addition, it produces an in-
          bound 3270 data stream from the updated screen image.

          As with the Data Stream Mode, Field Mode insulates the OpenVMS user
          from the SNA protocol. Extended attributes are not supported by the
          Field Mode connection.

          Programming Interface for OpenVMS, Version 1.6

          Asynchronous Event Notification

          The 3270 DS product provides a mechanism for an OpenVMS user appli-
          cation to receive control when an asynchronous "network event" occurs,
          such as disconnection of a DECnet logical link, an SNA circuit fail-
          ure, or the receipt of an Unbind Type 2 from IBM. The OpenVMS appli-
          cation is called at a notification entry point defined by the appli-
          cation at connection time; an indication of the event that occurred
          is reported.

          User Interface

          Users of the 3270 DS product should be experienced OpenVMS applica-
          tion programmers. They can use any of the OpenVMS programming languages
          that conform to the OpenVMS Calling Standard to create application pro-
          grams that interact with application programs on an IBM system. The
          user documentation provides example segments written in the follow-
          ing languages:

          o  MACRO-32

          o  BLISS-32 Implementation Language

          o  C

          o  COBOL

          o  FORTRAN

          o  PASCAL

          o  PL/I

          Users of the 3270 DS product are not required to have extensive knowl-
          edge of SNA.

          INSTALLATION

          Installation services from Compaq are recommended for a customer's first
          purchase of this software product. These services provide for instal-
          lation of the software product by an experienced software specialist.
