HIGHLIGHTS

The following paragraphs briefly highlight the features of DTF for Open-
VMS. More detailed information is given in the Features section of this
SPD.

Client/Server-Style Operation

The DTF for OpenVMS product provides a client/server style of oper-
ation. The OpenVMS DTF server can support file operations between IBM
OS/390 and OpenVMS in a DECnet or TCP/IP environment. No additional
software is required on other nodes in the OpenVMS network (except for
OpenVMS recoverable copy operations). Refer to the Configuration sec-
tion of this SPD for more information.

Ease of Use

DTF for OpenVMS provides a familiar user interface for both Compaq and
IBM users. This feature supports easy application development and re-
duces staff training.

Comprehensive, Bidirectional Access

The DTF for OpenVMS product enables bidirectional file transfer be-
tween all DTF-supported nodes and IBM OS/390 systems.

Checkpoint and Recovery

DTF for OpenVMS provides OpenVMS and IBM users with checkpoint and re-
covery support in the event of a system or network failure. This fea-
ture allows DTF to resume an interrupted recoverable copy operation
when the network returns to a normal state. This saves significant time
and system resources when large files are transferred.

File Backup

                                 2

 

DTF for OpenVMS allows OpenVMS users to target IBM disks and tapes for
backup and restore operations. In large co-resident Compaq and IBM sites,
this capability optimizes system resource usage. Users have the abil-
ity to include an allocation space qualifier when backing up files to
target IBM disks to ensure proper disk space availability.

Remote Job Submission

DTF for OpenVMS users can submit jobs remotely from all clients.

Post-Processing

Using DTF for OpenVMS, OpenVMS, and IBM, users can provide a post-processing
file to be executed after a file transfer is completed. This feature
allows OpenVMS and IBM users to logically connect the running of a batch
job to the successful completion of a DTF file transfer. This makes
the implementation of distributed processing functions significantly
easier to synchronize between IBM applications and OpenVMS-based ap-
plications.

Record-Level Access

DTF for OpenVMS supports record-level access from OpenVMS systems to
IBM OS/390 systems.

Supported File Types

DTF for OpenVMS supports multiple file types (RMS, VSAM, and BSAM),
allowing easy applications development. DTF also supports mixed case
IBM file specifications.

HSM Support

DTF for OpenVMS supports IBM's Hierarchical Storage Management (HSM)
facility.

IBM Enterprise Architecture and SMS Support

DTF for OpenVMS runs in compliance with IBM's Enterprise Architecture
and will support SMS-managed data sets (refer to the Supported IBM Con-
figurations section).

                                 3

 

Data Translation Using Load Balancing and Performance Tuning

DTF for OpenVMS supports text translation from Compaq DMCS (Digital
Multinational Character Set, a superset of ASCII) to EBCDIC and vice
versa on a record-by-record basis. DTF for OpenVMS supports load bal-
ancing and performance tuning between the IBM system and the OpenVMS
DTF server node by allowing users to select which system performs the
text translation. Enhanced performance of the OpenVMS DTF server of-
ten results when this translation is performed on the IBM system.

Data Security

DTF for OpenVMS controls access and protects valuable data with su-
perior security capabilities. The mainframe component supports the industry-
standard SAF security interface that runs on IBM machines.

Proxy access to the IBM system allows OpenVMS users to access the OS/390
system without IBM userids and passwords flowing over the network con-
nections.

Server Management

The DTF for OpenVMS product includes a management utility to manage
the OpenVMS DTF server.

Event Logging

The mainframe component logs events which can be used for historical
inquiry or accounting. System programmers can easily write special-
ized accounting and bill-back reports using DTF's logs.

Components

There are three components to the Compaq SNA Data Transfer Facility
for OpenVMS Version 3.3A product:

o  Data Transfer Facility server (OpenVMS DTF server), Version 3.3

o  Data Transfer Facility utilities (OpenVMS DTF utilities), Version
   3.3

o  Mainframe Data Transfer Facility (MDU), Version 3.2

                                 4

 

OpenVMS DTF Server

The OpenVMS DTF server software can be installed on any OpenVMS Al-
pha or OpenVMS VAX system in a network containing an SNA gateway or
server. The node that is running the OpenVMS DTF server software is
referred to as the server node. All DTF file requests go through this
server node which communicates with the Mainframe DTF system using an
SNA gateway or server. The DTF server software also performs text trans-
lation (DMCS/EBCDIC). However, this can be done optionally by the MDU
software. The OpenVMS DTF server software includes the OpenVMS DTF util-
ities software described in the next section.

OpenVMS DTF Utilities

The OpenVMS DTF utilities software is an optional component that can
be installed on any OpenVMS system where users wish to transfer files
using the recoverable copy feature. The utilities software should also
be installed if IBM users will be requesting recoverable copies in-
volving that OpenVMS node. The utilities software consists of a server
management utility and a checkpoint/recovery utility (TRANSFER/DTF).
The OpenVMS DTF utilities software communicates with the OpenVMS DTF
server software to accomplish the data transfer. It is not necessary
to install the OpenVMS DTF utilities software on the server node since
these utilities are included in the OpenVMS DTF server software pack-
age.

Mainframe DTF

Mainframe DTF (MDU) is a layered software product that operates on an
IBM mainframe. The Mainframe DTF (MDU) software can be installed on
any IBM S/370-class, IBM S/390-class, or IBM zSeries Server running
in 31-bit mode.

MDU accepts file operation commands from the OpenVMS DTF server soft-
ware and maps them into OS/390 file commands to perform the operation.
It also provides interfaces so TSO users can issue recoverable and non-
recoverable copy commands in interactive or batch mode. MDU software
consists of two parts: a VTAM application program that controls the
communications with the OpenVMS DTF server nodes for the purpose of
transferring files, and user interfaces. The three user interfaces are:

                                 5

 

a TSO command processor, a single-line command interface (REXX required),
and an ISPF dialog.

The MDU software can also be used to communicate with Compaq Tru64 UNIX
systems. Refer to Compaq Data Transfer Facility for Tru64 UNIX Soft-
ware Product Description 60.54.xx.

Configuration

MDU must be installed on each IBM system with which users want to com-
municate. The Compaq network requires one OpenVMS DTF server compo-
nent installed on a OpenVMS system, and may require multiple server
component installations depending on the amount of use of DTF. Other
OpenVMS nodes in the network do not require any additional software
since DTF allows users to use standard file transfer commands to ac-
cess IBM files. The OpenVMS DTF utilities software is required only
if a particular OpenVMS system's users need the recoverable copy fea-
ture or if IBM users desire recoverable copy operations to that Open-
VMS system. Recoverable copy works only to OpenVMS nodes with the Open-
VMS DTF server software or the OpenVMS DTF utilities software installed.

FEATURES

The DTF for OpenVMS product uses a variety of familiar user interfaces
to make users more productive. Users do not have to learn new commands
and procedures.

Users in the OpenVMS environment can issue standard DCL commands, like
COPY, TYPE, DIRECTORY, and so on. Alternatively, they can use the Record
Management System (RMS) programming interface or the TRANSFER/DTF util-
ity for data exchange between OpenVMS and IBM systems.

IBM OS/390 users can access and transfer data by using the TSO DTF com-
mand processor, the TSO ISPF panels, or the single-line interface. The
TSO command processor can also be invoked in batch mode.

DTF Access from OpenVMS Clients

OpenVMS DTF users can initiate non-recoverable or recoverable, bidi-
rectional file transfers between IBM DTF clients and themselves. DTF
supports the following OpenVMS DCL commands.

Note: Some of the qualifiers associated with these DCL commands are sub-
ject to restrictions when used with DTF.

APPEND        DELETE           SEARCH

BACKUP        DIFFERENCES      REMOTE
              SUBMIT

CLOSE         DIRECTORY        TYPE

CONVERT       EXCHANGE/NETWORK WRITE

COPY          OPEN

CREATE        READ

DTF Access from OS/390

IBM DTF users can initiate nonrecoverable or recoverable, bidirectional
file transfers between OpenVMS DTF clients running the OpenVMS/DTF util-
ities software and themselves. In addition, they can initiate nonre-
coverable, bidirectional file transfer between all other DTF clients
(including other IBM systems) and themselves. OS/390 TSO users have
the following commands available to transfer files to or from other
DTF clients.

processor

Checkpoint and Recovery

Checkpoint and recovery capabilities ensure that data remains accu-
rate and intact, even in the event of system or network failure. When
OpenVMS users transfer files using the TRANSFER/DTF utility, it au-
tomatically resumes an interrupted file-transfer process with no loss
of data when communications between sending and receiving systems is
reestablished. Checkpoint and recovery is supported for non-VSAM files

                                 7

 

that are disk or tape resident. Checkpoint and recovery is not sup-
ported on VSAM files.

IBM users have a similar checkpoint and recovery feature. A recover-
able copy operation performed from an IBM system sets environment vari-
ables (CLIST in OS/390). If the transfer terminates with a network er-
ror, these variables contain information to allow the user to resume
the transfer.

File Backup

DTF for OpenVMS allows OpenVMS users to back up and restore their disks
directly to IBM tapes or disks using the OpenVMS BACKUP command. Users
have the ability to include an allocation space qualifier when back-
ing up files to target IBM disks to ensure proper disk space avail-
ability.

Remote Job Submission

OpenVMS users can submit JCL files on the IBM system to be executed
by JES or by a batch machine. These users can use the standard file
operation commands to initiate the job submission. For example, Open-
VMS users use SUBMIT/REMOTE. Users will not get the status of the job
completion. IBM DTF users can submit jobs by using the post-processing
feature described in the next section.

Post-Processing

Post-processing is the ability to submit a DCL command procedure or
OS/390 JCL procedure after a file transfer is completed. IBM users can
use the post-processing feature from either the command processor or
the panel interface. OpenVMS users can use the post-processing fea-
ture only through the TRANSFER/DTF utility.

Record-Level Access

DTF for OpenVMS allows an OpenVMS user record-level access to IBM files
by means of an RMS application or DCL commands. DTF does not support
record-level access initiated from IBM to OpenVMS RMS files.

Supported File Types

                                 8

 

All OpenVMS file types are supported. ODS-5 Extended File Specifica-
tion is not supported.

For IBM OS/390 systems, supported non-VSAM file types are those with
the physical sequential data set organization. This includes normal
sequential files as well as partitioned data set members. Both disk-
resident and tape-resident non-VSAM files are supported. Supported VSAM
file types include entry-sequenced data sets (ESDS), relative-record
data sets (RRDS), and key-sequenced data sets (KSDS).

DTF for OpenVMS provides an option for users to overcome the null record
restriction by substituting a record containing a character or value
chosen by the user. A mixed-case option supports applications on the
IBM side that create file specifications that are case sensitive. The
case qualifier supports file specifications that contain lower case
characters.

HSM Support

MDU supports the Hierarchical Storage Management (HSM) facility and
allows users to recall migrated data sets. IBM system programmers can
tailor the number of concurrent outstanding HSM requests as well as
device recall capability.

SMS Support

MDU supports the OS/390 Storage Management Subsystem (SMS) facility.

Data Translation

DTF for OpenVMS provides two options for data translation: no data trans-
lation at all and Compaq DMCS (Digital Multinational Character Set,
a superset of ASCII) to EBCDIC and vice versa.

o  Users can specify that DTF for OpenVMS should perform no data trans-
   lation during a file transfer. This option is useful for transfer-
   ring image files.



                                 9

 

o  By default, DTF for OpenVMS performs data translation from DMCS to
   EBCDIC and vice versa on a record-by-record basis. This is the op-
   tion normally used to transfer text files.

By default, data translation is performed on the OpenVMS DTF server
node. To decrease the load on the OpenVMS DTF server, the server man-
ager can optionally specify that data translation (DMCS/EBCDIC) oc-
cur on the IBM DTF system.

Data Security

Files on the IBM system are accessible only to Compaq users with valid
access control information. MDU provides a standard user exit for se-
curity mechanisms through the System Authorization Facility (SAF) in-
terface. For OpenVMS systems, security is maintained by using the stan-
dard file protection mechanism provided by the base operating system.

MDU also allows proxy information to be stored on the IBM system us-
ing standard IBM system security packages.

For ease of use, the proxy information allows OpenVMS users to per-
form file transfers without having to provide passwords for their files
located on the IBM system.

Server Management

DTF for OpenVMS provides a management utility to manage the server ac-
count database, the file definition database, and the DTF proxy databases
on the OpenVMS DTF server. The server account database allows the server
to support file transfer requests to many different IBM DTF clients.
The file definition database allows users to store the IBM file spec-
ifications for frequently accessed files. The proxy database allows
the server manager to set up mappings that allow users to enter re-
quests without specifying their IBM passwords. Refer to the Data Se-
curity section for more information.

Event Logging



                                10

 

MDU logs events which can be used for historical inquiry or for ac-
counting usage. Historical logging can be used to characterize the use
of MDU. Such information is necessary for decisions involving oper-
ating hours, performance tuning, and load analysis of the network and
operating system. Account logging allows users of MDU functions to be
recorded along with the resources they consume. The granularity of the
information is sufficient to provide a bill-back capability. Imple-
mentation of the accounting and billing capability is handled with a
user exit and can be customized on a per-site basis.
