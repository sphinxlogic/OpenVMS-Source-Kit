          PRODUCT NAME:  Compaq SNA Domain Gateway,              SPD 38.69.04
                         Version 2.1A

          DESCRIPTION

          Compaq SNA Domain Gateway (Domain Gateway) is a member of Compaq's fam-
          ily of Compaq SNA network transport products. This family consists of
          hardware and software products that connect suitably configured net-
          worked systems in a Compaq environment with suitably configured IBM
          systems in a Systems Network Architecture (SNA) environment. With ap-
          propriate OpenVMS, Tru64 UNIX, and DECnet-Plus access routines, users
          can exchange information and share resources between Compaq and IBM
          networked systems in a bidirectional manner.
          The Domain Gateway is managed and configured using the management soft-
          ware that is part of the Domain Gateway product.

          The Domain Gateway supports TCP/IP and DECnet-Plus network protocols.
          Networks using these protocols are referred to as the non-SNA networks.
          The Domain Gateway is part of both the SNA network and the non-SNA net-
          work. Architecturally, it is a DECnet-Plus and/or TCP/IP end node and
          an SNA Physical Unit Type 5 (PU T5) node. The Domain Gateway appears
          to the SNA network as an SNA domain that contains one subarea.

          The Compaq SNA Domain Gateway software is supported on the DEC Chan-
          nelServer II hardware platform [DESNB] and the DEC MicroServer hard-
          ware platform [DEMSA]. When used with the Domain Gateway software, each
          of these hardware products provides SNA connectivity to any DECnet-
          Plus or TCP/IP system in the non-SNA network.

          Note: The DEC ChannelServer II [DESNB] and DEC MicroServer [DEMSA] hard-
          ware platforms are no longer available from Compaq. However, hardware
          and software support for these products will continue. For details,
          please contact your local Compaq representative.

                                                                   April 2001

 



          Compaq SNA Domain Gateway,                            SPD 38.69.04
          Version 2.1A

          The DEC ChannelServer II hardware unit connects directly to an Eth-
          ernet local area network (LAN), using a standard Ethernet transceiver
          cable, and to an IBM S/370 Block Multiplexer channel, using a single
          set of Bus and Tag connectors. The combination of the Domain Gateway
          software and the DEC ChannelServer II hardware unit is referred to as
          a Domain Gateway-CT.

          The DEC MicroServer hardware unit connects directly to an Ethernet LAN,
          using a standard Ethernet transceiver cable. The DEC MicroServer hard-
          ware unit connects to up to four front-end communications controllers
          (37**-style), using standard synchronous data lines and modems. These
          front-end processors must all be in the same SNA network. The combi-
          nation of the Domain Gateway software and the DEC MicroServer hard-
          ware unit is referred to as a Domain Gateway-ST.

          This product can be used in networks currently using other Compaq SNA
          gateways and can share access routines, Ethernet LANs, and load host
          resources with those systems.

          The Domain Gateway supports a single physical unit (PU) with its own
          System Services Control Point (SSCP). The Domain Gateway supports up
          to 16 explicit routes for each destination subarea in the SNA network,
          supports IBM Class of Service capability, and allows up to eight vir-
          tual routes (each of which can have three transmission priority lev-
          els) for each explicit route. The Domain Gateway-CT supports a sin-
          gle transmission group (TG). The Domain Gateway-ST supports multiple
          (up to four) TGs and multilink TGs.

          The Domain Gateway-CT supports the configuration of up to 1024 log-
          ical units (LUs), and the Domain Gateway-ST supports up to 128 LUs.
          All LUs can have multiple sessions. Table 1 shows the maximum number
          of active LU-LU sessions supported by the two hardware platforms.

          Because the Domain Gateway is a PU T5 implementation, it enables DECnet-
          Plus or TCP/IP based applications to be either primary logical units
          (PLUs) or secondary logical units (SLUs) when communicating with IBM
          applications and peripheral devices. This means that suitably config-
          ured Compaq based applications can be interactively accessed from IBM
          SNA networked 3270 devices.

          Features Common to All Domain Gateways

          o  Implements an SNA PU T5

          o  Multiple session support for each LU

          o  Supports applications acting as either PLUs or SLUs

          o  Provides access to OpenVMS Alpha, OpenVMS VAX, and Tru64 UNIX ap-
             plications from SNA 3270 devices

          o  Implements IBM Class of Service support

          o  Supports SNA explicit routes, virtual routes, and transmission pri-
             ority levels

          o  Supports a wide variety of access routines

          o  Supports IBM MVS, VM, and VSE systems

          o  Gateway Configuration Utility simplifies installation and config-
             uration

             of 128

          o  Supports NRZI signaling mode on its synchronous data lines. This
             allows the Domain Gateway to support IBM data lines coded with ei-
             ther the NORMAL or NRZI option for the IBM NCP LINE resource def-
             inition

          o  Supports full duplex transmission on its synchronous data lines.
             This allows data to be sent and received simultaneously. This set-
             ting corresponds to the DATMODE = FULL option for the IBM NCP PU
             resource definition

          Loading Compaq SNA Domain Gateway Software

          The Domain Gateway software is downline loaded into the DEC ChannelServer
          II or DEC MicroServer product over the Ethernet LAN from an OpenVMS
          Alpha, OpenVMS VAX, or Tru64 UNIX system, acting as DECnet-Plus load
          hosts. Most OpenVMS Alpha, OpenVMS VAX, and Tru64 UNIX systems can be
          used as Domain Gateway load hosts. The Hardware Requirements section
          of this Software Product Description describes valid configurations.
          Other networked systems requiring access to the SNA environment through
          the Domain Gateway should be configured with the appropriate SNA ac-
          cess routines.

          When loaded on the DEC ChannelServer hardware unit, the Domain Gate-
          way appears to the SNA network as an IBM 3088 Channel-to-Channel Adapter
          (CTCA). System programmers configure the IBM channel address as a 3088
          device according to specifications listed in both the hardware and soft-
          ware user documentation.

          When loaded on the DEC MicroServer hardware unit, the Domain Gateway
          appears to adjacent front-end processors as another front-end proces-
          sor and appears to IBM hosts in the SNA network as another IBM host.
          IBM system programmers should configure the adjacent front-end pro-
          cessors and adjacent IBM hosts according to specifications listed in
          both the hardware and software user documentation.

          Compaq SNA Domain Gateway,                            SPD 38.69.04
          Version 2.1A

          Components

          The Compaq SNA Domain Gateway software includes two software compo-
          nents: the Domain Gateway Load Host software (with its Configuration
          Utility) and the Domain Gateway Management software.

          Domain Gateway Load Host Software

          The Domain Gateway Load Host software includes the system image that
          is downline loaded to one of the supported hardware units and the Con-
          figuration Utility that provides a convenient method for configuring
          the Domain Gateway.

          The Configuration Utility allows Domain Gateway managers to save an-
          swers and to modify discrete parts of the configuration. The Config-
          uration Utility can also read path definition files created by IBM net-
          work definition utilities and use that information in the Domain Gate-
          way configuration.

          Because the Domain Gateway supports multiple sessions per LU, the Do-
          main Gateway manager can configure a single LU for the access routines
          that support multiple sessions, thus reducing configuration time.

          Most Tru64 UNIX, OpenVMS Alpha, and OpenVMS VAX systems can serve as
          Domain Gateway load hosts.

          Domain Gateway Management Software

          The Domain Gateway Management software includes DECnet-Plus style net-
          work management tools for configuring, controlling, monitoring, and
          troubleshooting the Domain Gateway. The Domain Gateway manager can set
          up or modify parameters relating to routes, physical units, logical
          units, and other key variables necessary for network-to-network com-
          munications between the SNA and non-SNA networks. In addition, the Do-
          main Gateway Management software allows the manager to diagnose and
          solve most problems related to the Domain Gateway. These DECnet style
          network management tools are also available in a TCP/IP-only environ-
          ment.

          Compaq SNA Domain Gateway,                            SPD 38.69.04
          Version 2.1A

          Although all management of the Domain Gateway is performed from a gate-
          way management node in the non-SNA network, the management of the Do-
          main Gateway's SNA components is conceptually part of the management
          of the IBM SNA network. Therefore, the management of the routes and
          the data links connecting the Domain Gateway to the IBM network is the
          joint responsibility of the IBM system or network programmer and the
          Domain Gateway manager.

          The Domain Gateway Management software includes support for Network
          Control Language (NCL) commands, a monitoring utility (SNAP), and Com-
          mon Trace Facility (CTF) analysis routines. The SNAP utility displays
          the status of the Domain Gateway's buffer availability, the number of
          SNA sessions in progress, and information about the non-SNA and SNA
          networks. The CTF analysis routines help debug application programs
          and assist in identifying system problems by capturing and analyzing
          multiprotocol data. CTF can be used at the transmission group, vir-
          tual route, logical unit, or session level.

          The Domain Gateway Management software resides on a Domain Gateway load
          host system or, optionally, on additional nodes called Domain Gate-
          way management nodes.

          Most Tru64 UNIX, OpenVMS Alpha, and OpenVMS VAX systems can serve as
          Domain Gateway management hosts.

          Access Routines

          OpenVMS and Tru64 UNIX Compaq access routines can use the Domain Gate-
          way. The Domain Gateway supports Compaq-supplied access routines as
          either SLUs or PLUs. For example, an application written for Compaq
          SNA 3270 Applications Services access routine could enable 3270 ter-
          minals in an SNA network to connect to applications on OpenVMS sys-
          tems. The Domain Gateway works with all of the Compaq SNA access rou-
          tines. However,the Domain Gateway does not have a Remote Job Entry (RJE)
          server. Instead, the Compaq SNA RJE access routine uses an OpenVMS based
          RJE server. For additional information about supported access routines,
          see the Optional Software section of this Software Product Descrip-
          tion.

          These counts refer to the disk space required on the system disk. The
          sizes are approximate; actual sizes may vary depending on the user's
          system environment, configuration, and software options.

          In addition to disk space allocated to the Domain Gateway software,
          some disk space (approximately 8K to 10K blocks) should be reserved
          for any dump files that may be generated by the Domain Gateway. The
          location of these dump files is determined by the system administra-
          tor. In addition, each Domain Gateway configured will require addi-
          tional disk space for configuration scripts (upwards of 40 blocks [20
          KB]).

          Communications Hardware Required

          Domain Gateway software runs on two hardware platforms: the DEC Chan-
          nelServer II and the DEC MicroServer.

          DEC ChannelServer II

          The DEC ChannelServer II hardware unit is no longer available, but is
          supported by the Domain Gateway software in the following forms:

          o  DESNB-AA for use with 120 V ac power supplies

          o  DESNB-A3 for use with 240 V ac power supplies

          Each DEC ChannelServer II hardware unit has a built-in Ethernet LAN
          controller, but needs a suitable connection to connect to the customer's
          Ethernet LAN along with any extension cables.

          Version 2.1A

          In addition, S/370 Bus and Tag cables (with terminators, if appropri-
          ate) are required for connection into the S/370 system.

          Note: A raised-floor environment is required for installation of a DEC
          ChannelServer II system.

          DEC MicroServer

          The DEC MicroServer is no longer available, but is supported by the
          Domain Gateway software in the following forms:

          o  DEMSA-AA for use with 120 V ac power supplies

          o  DEMSA-AB for use with 240 V ac power supplies

          The DEC MicroServer-SP is no longer available, but is supported by the
          Domain Gateway software in the following forms:

          o  DEMSB-AA for use with 120 V ac power supplies

          o  DEMSB-AB for use with 240 V ac power supplies

          Each DEC MicroServer hardware unit has a built-in Ethernet LAN con-
          troller, but needs a suitable connection to connect to the customer's
          Ethernet LAN along with any extension cables.

          Each DEC MicroServer hardware unit uses adapter cables to provide the
          necessary interchange circuits at the appropriate electrical inter-
          face types and ISO standard connections for each synchronous line. The
          DEC MicroServer supports up to four synchronous lines; therefore, it
          requires up to four adapter cables. Table 3 shows the cable number for
          each of the supported electrical interfaces.

          SOFTWARE LICENSING

          Customers need a separate license for each hardware unit they load with
          the Domain Gateway software (except as otherwise specified by Compaq).
          The Compaq SNA Domain Gateway license applies to the hardware unit on
          which the software executes, not to the load host processor on which
          the software is configured.

          The single Domain Gateway license agreement includes the right to in-
          stall and configure the product on a backup load host, in standby mode,
          for downline loading the Domain Gateway in case of a failure at the
          primary load host. This backup load host installation requires dupli-
          cate installation of the primary Product Access Key (PAK).

          Under the terms of the software license, the Domain Gateway manage-
          ment utilities that are included in this product (NCL commands, SNAP,
          and CTF analysis routines) may be installed freely on alternate Gate-
          way management nodes in addition to the load host. A PAK is not nec-
          essary to install or execute the management utilities.

          This software is furnished under the licensing provision of Compaq Com-
          puter Corporation's Standard Terms and Conditions. For more informa-
          tion about Compaq's licensing terms and policies, contact your local
          Compaq representative.

          License Management Facility Support

          This product supports the License Management Facility on OpenVMS and
          Tru64 UNIX.
