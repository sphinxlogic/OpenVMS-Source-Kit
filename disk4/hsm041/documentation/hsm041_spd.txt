PRODUCT NAME:  Hierarchical Storage Management         SPD 46.38.20
               for OpenVMS Version 4.1

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

HP Hierarchical Storage Management (HSM) for OpenVMS is a layered soft-
ware product that extends the OpenVMS file system to allow efficient
management of infrequently accessed (dormant) data. HSM migrates dor-
mant data from online storage to less expensive nearline or offline
(shelf) storage. The movement of dormant data to shelf storage is called
shelving. The shelved data can be automatically and transparently re-
turned to online storage when needed. HSM will also save valuable backup
time, since the shelved data is already located on secure, removable
media.

HSM for OpenVMS Operation

HSM operates in Basic or Plus Mode. Basic mode uses its own media man-
ager and qualifies a limited number of device types. Plus mode allows
the use of advanced storage devices. If used for remote tape devices,
Plus Mode requires the Remote Device Facility[TM] (RDF) software. See
the OPTIONAL SOFTWARE section for details.

New and frequently accessed files remain online while older and less
active files are automatically, or manually, shelved in accordance with
user-defined policies. The directory information and file headers for
shelved files are maintained on online storage devices while the data
itself is on the shelf device. When access is needed to the shelved
data, HSM automatically returns it to online storage. The file attributes
may be viewed and modified without bringing the data back online.

                                                       January 2003

Control over the execution of the shelving process is either explicit
or implicit. Explicit shelving is a process that has been started in
response to a DCL command. The command can be issued directly to the
OpenVMS Operating System or executed in an OpenVMS command procedure.
Implicit shelving is a process that has been started by HSM in response
to a trigger event or policy.

The transparent management of HSM is set through HSM policies which:

o  Specify which files are or are not to be shelved

o  Set a high water mark on the online storage to automatically trig-
   ger shelving of dormant data

o  Set a low water mark as a space recovered goal when your files are
   shelved

o  Specify which processes should cause automatic unshelving

HSM policies use predefined selection algorithms or scripts contain-
ing HSM-specific commands to shelve or unshelve files in response to
trigger events. Trigger events are situations that, when set by an HSM
policy, cause HSM to move files to shelf storage. Examples of specific
trigger events are listed below:

o  Volume occupancy full

o  Disk quota exceeded

o  High water mark reached

o  Scheduled policy execution

Trigger events, used in conjunction with appropriately designed se-
lection criteria, free up enough online disk space to satisfy the pol-
icy goal.

The selection criteria include definitions that determine the appro-
priate files to be shelved in response to the need for shelving. Ex-
amples of selection criteria include:

o  Least recently used and size combination

o  Least recently used

                                 2

 

o  According to a user-defined script

HSM for OpenVMS qualifies file access to shelved files on client sys-
tems where access is through DFS, NFS, or PATHWORKS.

SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS

o  HSM V4.1 runs on the OpenVMS Alpha V6.2, V7.1-2, V7.2-2, V7.3 and
   V7.3-1 and OpenVMS VAX Operating System V6.2, V7.1, V7.2 and V7.3.
   HSM V4.1 does not utilize the ODS5 disk structure.

   NOTE: Storage Management makes every effort to be as current or cor-
   rect as possible in qualifying our layered products on the Oper-
   ating System (OS) versions. The use of a particular OS by a cus-
   tomer can only be guaranteed by the customer's contract with Open-
   VMS or by a specific service contract.

                                 4

 

o  HSM Basic Mode does not require any software other than HSM and the
   OpenVMS Operating System.

o  HSM Plus Mode requires a media manager. If HSM is used with Stor-
   age Library System, SLS, then HSM will use the SLS media manager,
   MDMS V2.9G, which comes with SLS.

o  If HSM is used with Archive Backup System, ABS, then HSM will use
   the media manager installed by ABS as part of the ABS product in-
   stallation. This is the same media manager MDMS V4.1 that is pro-
   vided with the HSM V4.1 kit.

o  If HSM Plus Mode is not used with either SLS or ABS, then just in-
   stall the MDMS V4.1 provided in the HSM V4.1. The media manager (MDMS)
   is still a manual install with HSM V4.1 as users may continue to
   use SLS/MDMS V2.9G in their environment.

o  OpenVMS Version 7.3 provides support for Fibre Channel (FC) con-
   nected tape devices. This is accomplished through the use of Mod-
   ular Data Router (MDR) connected to the FC Switch. MDR converts Fi-
   bre Channel protocol to SCSI protocol, which the tape device un-
   derstands. HSM V4.1 has qualified this new feature in OpenVMS 7.3
   as used with MDR. Please refer to OpenVMS V7.3 for a complete list-
   ing of supported tape devices.

o  Network Storage Router (NSR) M2402 by HP is a key component in a
   complete data protection solution. It allows multiple host servers
   to communicate with a SCSI tape device over a Fibre Channel link
   making backup speeds five times faster. HSM has been tested and qual-
   ified with Network Storage Router (NSR) M2402.

o  The HSM V4.1 is compatible with the Multipath failover function-
   ality on Tape devices as provided in OS 7.3-1.

OPTIONAL SOFTWARE

o  SLS Version 2.9G, or ABS Version V4.1, can be used in conjunction
   with HSM for an integrated Backup and HSM environment. SLS or ABS
   contains the Media, Device and Management Services software (MDMS).

                                 5

 

o  Remote access to tape devices in Plus Mode requires the Remote De-
   vice Facility [TM] (RDF). RDF requires a licesne. RDF is available
   as a component of the media manager, MDMS, which is part of your
   HSM V4.1 kit. RDF V4.3G has been qualified for HSM V4.1. This ca-
   pability is turned on through licensing of the following:

   -  Purchase of Storage Library System (SLS)

   -  Purchase of Archive Backup System (ABS)

   -  Purchase of an RDF license directly from Computer Associates In-
      ternational Inc.

License Management Facility

This layered product qualifies the OpenVMS License Management Facil-
ity.

For more information on the OpenVMS License Management Facility, re-
fer to the OpenVMS Operating System Software Product Description or
the License Management Facility manual of the OpenVMS Operating Sys-
tem documentation set.

Qualified Devices

The following libraries and loaders have been tested and qualified by
Storage Management Software Engineering. However, Storage Management
Software Engineering does not test each of the devices with every pos-
sible combination of controllers and host systems. Because the HSM prod-
uct and the Media Robot Utility (MRU) run in common environments, these
combinations are tested first with MRU. Upon successful completion of
the MRU tests, HSM is then tested in representative configurations.
Note that MRU is not a prerequisite for HSM.

Therefore, to determine if your specific configuration has been qual-
ified, follow these steps:

1. If you have a tape drive that is not software-defined as a juke-
   box (is not a library or a loader device), reference the OpenVMS
   Software Product Description (SPD 25.01.xx) to determine if your
   tape drive is qualifieded for your platform and controller/adapter
   combination.

2. If your device is software-defined as a jukebox (it is a library
   or loader device), first check the following list to determine if
   it has been qualified by the media manager. If the device is listed,
   see the following instructions:

   a. Check the OpenVMS Software Product Description (SPD 25.01.xx)
      to make sure the tape drive(s) in your library/loader are sup-
      ported for your platform and controller/adapter combination.



                                 7

 

   b. Check the MRU Software Product Description (SPD 64.44.xx) to make
      sure your library/loader is listed by MRU for your specific con-
      troller/adapter combination.

3. Assuming your device is correctly connected and configured, it has
   been qualified by the common media manager.

If you have devices that are not shown on the list, they may still be
qualified. HP continually tests its software on additional devices that
may have been released since the last publication of this SPD.

If you have a question about a particular device, contact customer sup-
port.
