 PRODUCT NAME:  Digital X.500 Directory Service         SPD 40.77.08

 DESCRIPTION

 Introduction

 The Digital[TM] X.500 Directory Service products may be used to im-
 plement a distributed network directory service following the CCITT
 X.500 Recommendations. These Recommendations split the functions of
 the directory between one of more Directory System Agents (DSA), where
 all information is held, and one or more Directory User Agents (DUA),
 from which all inquiries and other directory actions are made. Using
 the X.500 model, departments and organizations may adopt an incremen-
 tal independent approach to the establishment of a directory service
 using conforming products from multiple vendors. These separate im-
 plementations may then be connected together to provide a single log-
 ical directory service which spans the department, the organization,
 the region or the world, as appropriate. The Directory may contain in-
 formation on anything of interest, typically people, systems, network
 resources and databases and may be accessed both by individual users
 and applications.

 The Digital X.500 Directory Service product set includes:

 o  Digital X.500 Directory Server - a Directory System Agent

 o  Digital X.500 Administration Facility - a Directory User Agent


                                                          March 1997

                                                         AE-PX3PJ-TE

 

 Other Digital messaging and networking products, such as ALL-IN-1, Mail-
 Works for Digital UNIX and the InfoBroker Server, also provide the di-
 rectory user agent function in order to access information in the Dig-
 ital X.500 Directory Server.

 The Digital X.500 Directory Service products are based on the 1993 edi-
 tion of ISO/IEC 9594 and the CCITT X.500 series of Recommendations.

 Abstract Services

 The Digital X.500 Directory Service components provide and support all
 of the X.500 Abstract Services, including:

    Read         Read attributes from a named entry

    Compare      Test an attribute value without reading it

    Abandon      Abandon an outstanding operation

    List         List names of subordinate entries

    Search       Find entries matching a search expression

    Add          Create a new entry

    Entry

    Modify RDN   Rename an entry

                                  2

 

 Schema

 The Digital X.500 Directory Service uses a configurable schema allow-
 ing customer definition of attributes, object classes, structure rules,
 and name forms. The schema is installed individually at each DSA. A
 default schema that implements the schema in X.520 and X.521 (1993 edi-
 tion) as well as other useful definitions is included.

 Security

 The Digital X.500 Directory Service supports a subset of the Simpli-
 fied Access Control scheme from the 1993 edition of the standard. This
 allows administrators to define policies that control access rights
 (such as read, browse, modify, remove) to entries and individual at-
 tributes within a particular part of the directory (naming context).

 The Digital X.500 Directory Service allows for the authentication of
 users by name and password. It also allows access to be restricted based
 on network address, and, for chained operations, originating DSA.

 Distributed Operations

 The DSA supports standard X.500 distributed operations including chain-
 ing and referrals. Knowledge management of superior and subordinate
 references allows a Digital X.500 DSA to participate as a first-level
 DSA or a subordinate DSA in a multi-vendor distributed Directory In-
 formation Base (DIB).

 Replication

 The Digital X.500 Directory Service supports shadowing of data between
 DSAs, allowing data to be replicated in the network for availability
 and performance. Shadowing also allows replication of knowledge in-
 formation for distributed operation, access control policies and au-
 thentication information, thus reducing the amount of management re-
 quired.




                                  3

 

 Shadowed information is represented using the DSA Information Model
 defined in the 1993 edition of the standard. Digital X.500 Directory
 Service supports the shadowing service defined in X.525, including supplier-
 initiated and consumer-initiated agreements, both scheduled and on-
 change replication providing full or incremental updates.



































                                  4

 

 Protocols

 The Directory Service is based on the client-server model. The DSA server
 supports the directorySystemAC application context (DSP protocol) to
 communicate with other DSAs. Communications between server DSAs and
 client DUAs are supported by the directoryAccessAC application con-
 text (DAP protocol). DAP enables DUAs in other X.500 implementations
 to access the Digital X.500 Directory Service DSA and vice-versa. DSP
 enables full interworking with DSAs in other implementations.

 For shadowing, of the DSA supports shadowSupplierInitiatedAC and shad-
 owConsumerInitiatedAC application contexts in both the synchronous and
 asynchronous variants (DISP protocol) and the directoryOperational-
 BindingManagementAC application context (DOP protocol).

 The Digital X.500 Directory Service runs on the Digital UNIX, Open-
 VMS Alpha and OpenVMS VAX operating systems. It provides integrated,
 multi-protocol support allowing concurrent DAP and DSP access over OSI
 (using transport classes TP0, TP2, TP4) and RFC1006 over TCP/IP.

 In conjunction with the InfoBroker Server (see SPD 53.32.xx) access
 to the directory service may be obtained using LDAP (Lightweight Di-
 rectory Access Protocol). For the Digital UNIX environment, the un-
 limited system use license for the X.500 Directory Server includes the
 right to install and use the InfoBroker Server on the same system as
 the DSA. Where the InfoBroker Server is to be installed and run on a
 system separate from the DSA, or with a concurrent use DSA license,
 a separate InfoBroker Server license is required.

 Database

 The Digital X.500 Directory Service provides a Directory Information
 Base based on the 1993 edition of Extended Information Models. This
 indexed database supports high-performance searching and sophisticated
 matching including approximate (Soundex) match. The database is held
 in main memory to ensure optimal response times.




                                  5

 

 Service Management

 The Digital X.500 Directory Service provides DSA management conform-
 ing to Digital's Enterprise Management Architecture (EMA), integrated
 with DECnet/OSI[TM]. This provides remote management facilities to con-
 figure and control DSAs, and to log significant events.

 Programming Interface

 Application access to the Digital X.500 Directory Service is provided
 through the X/Open[TM] Company Limited's OSI-Abstract-Data Manipula-
 tion API and API to Directory Services, also known as the XDS/XOM Ap-
 plication Program Interface. Documentation, useful libraries and sup-
 porting files for the API are included with the X.500 Directory Server.

 The Digital X.500 Directory Service includes a base component that con-
 tains the DUA libraries and other supporting files necessary to sup-
 port applications written to the directory API. This base component,
 therefore, provides run-time client access to the API libraries; it
 is distributed with the Digital X.500 Directory Server product. The
 license for the Digital X.500 Directory Server includes the right to
 install this base component on any system having an application need-
 ing access to that properly licensed Digital X.500 Directory Server.
 It is not required to load a license into the License Management Fa-
 cility in order for the base kit to function.

 Directory User Agents

 The Digital X.500 Administration Facility provides a Directory User
 Agent. The Information Management Utility (DXIM) allows users to search
 and browse the directory and to maintain the data stored in it. Op-
 erations include the addition, modification, and deletion of entries.
 DXIM supports both DECwindows[TM] Motif[R] and command line interfaces.
 It can be used on a DSA node or remotely from any other node in the
 network.

 DXIM is configurable, based on the schema definitions, to support customer-
 defined attributes and classes.


                                  6

 

 Access to the Digital X.500 Directory Service may also be obtained through
 other Digital software products which contain the Directory User Agent
 function. For example, MailWorks for Digital UNIX will allow users of
 TeamLinks clients access to information in the X.500 Directory.

 STANDARDS SUPPORTED

 The Digital X.500 Directory Service products are implemented accord-
 ing to the the 1993 edition of ISO/IEC 9594 and the CCITT X.500 se-
 ries of Recommendations. The products have successfully completed test-
 ing to the Open Systems Testing Consortium (OSTC) 1988 X.500 confor-
 mance tests. The conformance testing was carried out by the United King-
 dom National Computer Centre, an accredited OSTC testing center, who
 produced OSTC test reports valid in all European Community states. The
 products have been registered by the U.S. National Institute of Stan-
 dards and Technology (NIST) as conformant to U.S. GOSIP.

 SOFTWARE LICENSING

 This software is furnished under the licensing provisions of Digital
 Equipment Corporation's Standard Terms and Conditions. For more in-
 formation about Digital's licensing terms and policies, contact your
 local Digital office.

 License Management Facility Support

 This layered product supports the Digital UNIX and OpenVMS License Man-
 agement Facilities (LMF).

 License units for the Digital X.500 Directory Server are allocated on
 an Unlimited System Use and Concurrent Use basis.

                                 16

 

 Each Server Concurrent Use license allows a specified number of en-
 tries to be added to the local directory database, according to the
 number of units in the license. The number of entries counted includes
 all sub-entries (access control, shadowing agreement and other sub-
 entries), intermediate entries in the naming hierarchy, a small num-
 ber of overhead entries used for internal DSA management purposes, all
 shadowed entries from other DSAs as well as normal entries such as those
 used by human users or used by other dependent software, for example
 MAILbus 400 MTA routing and gateway entries. In a messaging environ-
 ment with mail user agents, a MAILbus 400 MTA and gateways, a 5000 en-
 try DSA may only be sufficient to support a user population of 1000
 people. For further details of this mechanism, consult the product doc-
 umentation.

 The Server Unlimited System Use license imposes no fixed limits on di-
 rectory size.

 The Digital X.500 Directory Service includes a base component that con-
 tains the DUA libraries and other supporting files necessary to sup-
 port applications written to the directory API. This base component,
 therefore, provides run-time client access to the API libraries; it
 is distributed with the Digital X.500 Directory Server product. The
 license for the Digital X.500 Directory Server includes the right to
 install this base component on any system having an application need-
 ing access to that properly licensed Digital X.500 Directory Server.
 It is not required to load a license into the License Management Fa-
 cility in order for the base kit to function.

 The Unlimited System Use license for the Digital X.500 Directory Server
 for Digital UNIX allows the installation and use of the InfoBroker Server
 for Digital UNIX on the same Digital UNIX system as the Digital X.500
 Directory Server. This does not apply to the Concurrent Use license
 for the Digital X.500 Directory Server for Digital UNIX; in this case
 an additional InfoBroker Server license is required.

 License units for the Digital X.500 Administration Facility are al-
 located on a Unlimited System Use and Concurrent Use basis. Each Con-
 current Use license allows any one individual at a time to use the lay-
 ered product.
