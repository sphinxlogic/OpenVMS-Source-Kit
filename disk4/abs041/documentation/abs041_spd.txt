PRODUCT NAME:  HP Archive Backup System                SPD 48.16.22
               for OpenVMS Version 4.1

DESCRIPTION

Archive Backup System (ABS) for OpenVMS Version 4.1 is HP's primary
OpenVMS archive and backup product. For license options, see the sec-
tion titled LICENSE OPTIONS in this document.
ABS automates backup operations, provides for system archiving, and
makes it easy to find files stored on tapes and disks. ABS also pro-
vides client backup facilities for Windows NT, Tru64 UNIX, and remote
OpenVMS clients.

Features
ABS provides the following important file archiving and backup capa-
bilities:

o  A Graphical User Interface for defining archive and backup poli-
   cies, save and restore data, and for finding data objects and databases
   that have been backed up or archived using ABS.

o  Automatic, flexible scheduling of backup and archive operations for
   OpenVMS systems and for selected Windows NT and Tru64 UNIX clients.

o  Qualified for OpenVMS client backup and archiving operations di-
   rectly between disks and tape drives located on different systems
   using DECnet[TM] or DECnet-Plus[TM] network protocol.

o  Use of Windows NT and Tru64 UNIX clients backing up to the ABS Open-
   VMS server using TCP/IP network protocol.

o  Integration with HSM for OpenVMS (SPD #46.38.xx) to qualify "Backup
   via Shelving."

                                                       January 2003

                                                        AE-QHD6Y-TE

 

o  Online catalog of information about backed up and archived files,
   disk volumes and databases. This allows for retrieving files or restor-
   ing disk volumes without having to know the names of the tape vol-
   umes on which the data was saved.

o  Use of OpenVMS Queue Manager to schedule backup requests. ABS also
   provides integration with other OpenVMS and offbase scheduler prod-
   ucts.

o  Dynamic logicals for Pre- and Postprocessing commands.

o  Error recovery and reporting capability.

o  Compatibility with RMU/BACKUP and RMU/RESTORE, allowing backup and
   restore operations of Oracle Rdb[TM] V7.0-6, V7.0-6.1 and V7.0-9
   databases.

o  ABS V4.1 provides "System Backup to Tape" (SBT) feature for Ora-
   cle 8i and Oracle 9i, RMAN database users. RMAN must be configured
   and working prior to SBT implementation. Feature is alpha oriented.
   ABS V4.1 has qualifed SBT to work on jukeboxes, standalone and stacker
   tape devices.

o  Fast tape positioning.

o  Utilizes OpenVMS ODS2 and ODS5 disk volumes as provided by Open-
   VMS. When ABS is used with HSM, ODS5 volumes are not qualified.

o  Layers upon a robust and fully tested media manager that provides
   the following important media and device management capabilities:

   -  Effective use of all media capacity by appending multiple save
      sets of backed up or archived files to the same volume or vol-
      ume set

   -  Direct positioning to the start of each save set file during a
      restore operation using saved information about the tape posi-
      tion of each save set file

   -  Customization features to meet a variety of operational and site
      requirements

                                 2

 

   -  Qualified for unattended backup operations using automatic tape
      cartridge loaders; generic device recognition of some StorageTek[R]
      automated cartridge server

   -  Media life cycle control including maintenance of volume reten-
      tion period, availability status, location, and scheduling dates
      when volumes are to move offsite and return

   -  Maintenance of counters for each volume noting the number of times
      a volume has been mounted and the number of errors associated
      with the volume

   -  Media allocation control based on customer-defined media pools

   -  Built-in report generation and custom report generation capa-
      bility

   -  Security features to prevent unauthorized media or device use

   -  In an OpenVMS[TM] Cluster environment, automatic failure recov-
      ery from the loss of a processor to allow continuous access to
      the media databases

o  Integration with the Remote Device Facility (RDF[TM]).

   The RDF software is included within the media management software.
   RDF allows the media manager to access a tape from other OpenVMS
   nodes across the DECnet or DECnet-Plus network for ABS backup and
   archive operations.

   RDF makes access to remote tape drives invisible to ABS backup and
   archive operations by issuing commands as appropriate when a des-
   ignated tape drive is considered remote. The media manager also man-
   ages volume load requests to remote systems to allow unattended back-
   ups or to communicate with a console operator. The media manager
   makes no direct use of the remote disk capabilities within RDF.

   RDF includes the following capability:

   -  RDF servers that execute tape I/O requests on behalf of a re-
      mote client. Servers are located on systems that have tape drives
      attached or that can access drives through the OpenVMS TMSCP[TM]
      server.

                                 3

 

   -  RDF clients that provide the communications interface between
      applications reading or writing data to a tape drive and the RDF
      servers.

Remote Device Facility (RDF) is only qualified when it is being called
by ABS. RDF included with ABS is not intended to be run as a stand alone
application. RDF as a stand alone application is available from Touch
Technologies and qualified by Touch Technologies, Inc.

RDF V4.3G is minimum version to be used with ABS V4.1.

LICENSE OPTIONS

To qualify a variety of configuration requirements, the following ABS
license options are available:

o  ABS for OpenVMS VAX or Alpha Pre 4.0X should now be referenced as
   ABS/MDMS server due to policy database functionality in MDMS for
   V4.0X. No changes to license needed.

o  ABS Client for OpenVMS VAX or Alpha Pre 4.0X should now be refer-
   enced as ABS/MDMS client due to policy database functionality in
   MDMS for V4.0X. No changes to license needed.

o  NT Client-This is an optional purchase that enables you to add NT
   client nodes to your ABS operational environment.

o  Tru64 UNIX Client-This is an optional purchase that enables you to
   add Tru64 UNIX client nodes to your ABS operational environment.

o  Archive Backup System for OpenVMS Management Tools (ABS OMT) - ABS
   OMT provides a subset of the full functionality of Archive Backup
   System. ABS OMT is a product offered within the OpenVMS Enterprise
   Integration Package (EIP) and sold as a separate product.

ABS/MDMS Server for OpenVMS
ABS/MDMS Server for OpenVMS software provides ABS full operational modes,
as previously described, to the nodes or OpenVMS Cluster on which ABS
is executing. A node or OpenVMS Cluster executing ABS/MDMS server soft-
ware provides backup policy management services for itself and for any
OpenVMS, Windows NT, and Tru64 UNIX client nodes connected to it. At

                                 4

 

least one ABS/MDMS server license is required in the network. Two are
recommended to ensure failover capabilities.
ABS/MDMS server software manages the catalogs that record information
about user files backed up or archived under ABS/MDMS control at the
local node.

ABS/MDMS Client for OpenVMS
ABS/MDMS Client for OpenVMS software provides backup and archiving op-
erations for the OpenVMS node or OpenVMS Cluster on which it is ex-
ecuting, and it acts as a client of another node executing ABS/MDMS
server software when it requires policy information.

Windows NT and Tru64 UNIX Client
A Windows NT or Tru64 UNIX Client license allows backup scheduling and
archiving services for the Windows NT or Tru64 UNIX client node con-
figured within the ABS software environment.

ABS OMT
ABS OMT licenses a subset of the ABS features. The following lists the
features that are NOT implemented for ABS OMT:

o  OpenVMS Clients

o  Tape devices using RDF

o  Creation of storage and environment policies

o  Save requests scheduling options except the following:

   -  On demand - (ON_DEMAND)

   -  Weekly full/daily incremental -
      (DAILY_FULL_WEEKLY)

   -  One time only - (ONE_TIME_ONLY)

o  StorageTek silos and DCSC Jukeboxes

o  Scheduling options:

   -  Scheduler

                                 5

 

   -  External

The ABS OMT license includes one ABS OMT server license and one ABS
Windows NT client license. Additional Tru64 UNIX and Windows NT client
licenses are qualified. ABS OMT uses the default storage and execu-
tion class which can be modified. Additional storage and execution classes
cannot be defined. ABS OMT qualifies only one file catalog.

Qualified DEVICES

The following libraries and loaders have been tested and qualified by
Storage Management Software Engineering. However, Storage Management
Software Engineering does not test each of the devices with every pos-
sible combination of controllers and host systems. Because Archive Backup
System and Media Robot Utility (MRU) run in common environments, these
combinations are tested first with MRU. Upon successful completion of
the MRU tests, Archive Backup System is then tested in representative
configurations. Note that MRU is not a prerequisite for Archive Backup
System.
Therefore, to determine if your specific configuration has been qual-
ified, follow these steps:

1. If you have a tape drive that is not software-defined as a juke-
   box (is not a library or a loader device), reference the OpenVMS
   Software Product Description (SPD #25.01.xx) to determine if your
   tape drive is qualified for your platform and controller/adapter
   combination.

2. If your device is software-defined as a jukebox (it is a library
   or loader device), first check the following list to determine if
   it is tested by the media manager. If the device is listed, see the
   following instructions:

   a. Check the OpenVMS Software Product Description (SPD #25.01.xx)
      to make sure the tape drive(s) in your library/loader are qual-
      ified for your platform and controller/adapter combination.

   b. Check the MRU Software Product Description (SPD #64.44.xx) to
      make sure your library/loader is qualified by MRU for your spe-
      cific controller/adapter combination.

                                 6

 

3. Assuming your device is correctly connected and configured, it should
   work with ABS and its clients.

If you have devices that are not shown on the list, they may still have
been qualified. HP continually tests its software on additional de-
vices that may have been released since the last publication of this
SPD. If you have a question about a particular device, contact HP cus-
tomer support.

Note: The Storage Management Software organization makes every effort
to be as current and correct in our listing of compatible versions for
Operating Systems, hardware and third party software products. Ulti-
mately, your existing contract with any of these entities will take
precedent.
