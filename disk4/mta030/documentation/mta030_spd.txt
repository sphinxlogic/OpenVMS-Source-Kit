           Product Name:  MAILbus 400 Message Transfer Agent      SPD 42.83.07
                          for OpenVMS VAX, Version 3.0

           PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

           MAILbus 400[TM] Message Transfer Agent (MTA) for OpenVMS[TM] VAX[TM]
           is a layered software product that resides on an OpenVMS VAX system.
           MAILbus 400 MTA provides electronic messaging services in an open net-
           work environment. These services are used by messaging applications,
           such as user agents and gateways. MAILbus 400 MTA provides the elec-
           tronic messaging services of an X.400 MTA, designed to conform to the
           1992 CCITT series of recommendations and the 1988 joint CCITT and ISO
           Message Handling System Standards and their subsequent revisions. A
           messaging network based on MAILbus 400 MTAs can function as all, or
           part of, a Private Management Domain or Administration Management Do-
           main.

           MAILbus 400 MTA uses DECnet[TM]-Plus for OpenVMS VAX for OSI[R] pro-
           tocol support, and OpenVMS Enterprise Directory for eBusiness or Com-
           paq X.500 Directory Services. Note that only with OpenVMS Enterprise
           Directory for eBusiness can all the new features of V3.0 be realised.

           MAILbus 400 MTA operates over the OSI protocols, as supported by DECnet-
           Plus for OpenVMS VAX. MAILbus 400 MTA can also operate over TCP/IP net-
           works, using the RFC 1006 protocol, as supported by DECnet-Plus. The
           RFC 1006 protocol emulates the OSI Transport Service Protocol Class
           0 over a TCP/IP network service.

           MAILbus 400 MTA can communicate with:

           o  Another MAILbus 400 MTA

           o  A VAX Message Router[TM] X.400 Gateway

                                                                     June 2002

                                                                   AE-PVRPJ-TE

 



           MAILbus 400 Message Transfer Agent                    SPD 42.83.07
           for OpenVMS VAX, Version 3.0

           o  Another vendor's X.400 MTA

           MAILbus 400 MTA provides management services conforming to the Com-
           paq Enterprise Management Architecture (EMA), integrated with DECnet-Plus.
           This provides local and remote management of MAILbus 400 MTA opera-
           tion.

           MAILbus 400 MTA supports an interface for messaging applications such
           as user agents and gateways. Access to this is provided by MAILbus 400
           Application Program Interface for OpenVMS VAX.

           MAILbus 400 MTA provides the following services to collect informa-
           tion about messages:

           o  Accounting services, to record particular items of information about
              messages.

           o  Archiving services, to retain complete copies of messages.

           o  Message history logging services, to record information about mes-
              sages for tracing purposes.

           MAILbus 400 MTA provides an Interpersonal Messaging Service (IPMS) body-
           part conversion service, based on recipient capabilities registered
           in the directory. The set of bodypart converters provided with MAIL-
           bus 400 MTA provides a selected set of conversions between the fol-
           lowing body-part types:

           o  IA5

           o  Teletex

           o  ISO/6937

           o  General text (for ISO IR repertoires covering ISOLatin1, ISO/6937,
              and Teletex)

           o  DEC[TM] Multinational Character Set

           o  Message Router Text

           o  WPS-PLUS[TM]

           o  DECdx[TM]

           for OpenVMS VAX, Version 3.0

           o  Upgrades body-parts from BP15 to FTBP

           MAILbus 400 MTA supports conversion between Externally Defined Body-
           parts and File Transfer Body-parts. In addition to providing conver-
           sion services, MAILbus 400 MTA supports transfer and receipt of any
           X.400 IPMS body-part types, and non-IPMS content types.

           New Features and Capabilities in V3.0

           o  Secured deliver/Secured transfer to domain

           o  The ability of the system manager to secure distribution lists to
              ensure only those users specified can access the lists

           o  The system manager may now prevent the sending of messages exceed-
              ing a certain length, thereby alleviating the load on the MTA dur-
              ing peak times

           o  Generation of uniquely named FTBP attachments while upgrading from
              BP15 to FTBP

           o  The code is now compiled with Compaq DEC C

           o  Support for 256 parallel agent connections

           MAILbus 400 MTA is typically used in conjunction with other COMPAQ-
           supplied messaging products, such as user agents and gateways. The fol-
           lowing are examples of messaging products that can be used in conjunc-
           tion with MAILbus 400 MTA to provide a complete messaging solution:

           o  Compaq Office Server-An office system solution providing a wide range

           License Management Facility Support

           This layered product supports the OpenVMS License Management Facil-
           ity.

           License units for this product are allocated on an Unlimited System
           Use and Concurrent Use basis.

           Each Concurrent Use license allows a specified number of messages to
           be processed by the MAILbus 400 MTA in a 24 hour period. If the num-
           ber of messages processed by the MAILbus 400 MTA in a 24 hour period
           exceeds the number of messages for which the MAILbus 400 MTA is li-
           censed, a warning message is output to inform the users that they are
           in breach of their licensing agreement. The MAILbus 400 MTA will con-
           tinue to process messages even if the licensed number of messages is
           exceeded.

           WARRANTY LIMITATIONS

           Absolute fidelity between an original document and the resulting doc-
           ument after MAILbus 400 MTA for OpenVMS VAX has performed a body-part
           conversion on a message is not guaranteed. The differences between the
           X.400 IPMS body-part definitions are such that conversions can result
           in a change in the formatting or content of a message bodypart.

           SOFTWARE WARRANTY

           This software is provided by Compaq with a 90 day conformance warranty
           in accordance with the Compaq warranty terms applicable to the license
