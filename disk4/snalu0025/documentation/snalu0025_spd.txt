          PRODUCT NAME:  Compaq SNA Application Programming      SPD 26.86.08
                         Interface for OpenVMS, Version 2.5

          This SPD describes Compaq SNA Application Programming Interface for
          OpenVMS, which is available for the OpenVMS Alpha and OpenVMS VAX plat-
          forms. All information applies to both platforms unless otherwise in-
          dicated.

          DESCRIPTION

          The Compaq SNA Application Programming Interface for OpenVMS (API) is
          a layered software product that allows user-written applications run-
          ning on suitably configured OpenVMS systems within a DECnet or TCP/IP
          network or on suitably configured OpenVMS systems within an OpenVMS
          SNA environment to exchange information with cooperating applications
          on an IBM host. The API software exists in the OpenVMS system as a share-
          able image. Access between the cooperating Compaq and IBM applications
          is via one of the following SNA server or gateway products:

          TCP/IP or DECnet Connections

          o  Compaq SNA Peer Server

          o  Compaq SNA Domain Gateway

          o  Compaq SNA Access Server for Windows NT

          o  Compaq SNA Server for OpenVMS Alpha, a layered product that sup-
             ports local access as well as TCP/IP and DECnet clients

          DECnet Only Connections

          o  Compaq DECnet SNA Gateway for Synchronous Transport

          o  Compaq DECnet SNA Gateway for Channel Transport

                                                                   April 2001

          Interface for OpenVMS, Version 2.5

          o  Compaq SNA Server for OpenVMS VAX, an OpenVMS VAX layered product
             that supports local access as well as remote DECnet clients


          Features

          The Compaq SNA Application Programming Interface for OpenVMS (API) is
          a collection of subroutines designed to provide an easy-to-use inter-
          face for the OpenVMS application programmer who has a specific need
          to interface to an IBM application subsystem. It supports many dif-
          ferent types of sessions between OpenVMS applications and applications
          running on an IBM host.

          API implements all of the path control layer and portions of the trans-
          mission and data flow control layers of SNA. The interface supports
          a number of different applications, each of which uses the SNA func-
          tion management, data flow control, and transmission control layers
          in a different way. API is not limited to supporting a particular ap-
          plication, such as 3270 terminals or Remote Job Entry (RJE) worksta-
          tions; the supported session types are Logical Unit types 0, 1, 2, and
          3, using the FM and TS profile types 3 and 4, as described in the prod-
          uct documentation.

          API provides extensive parameter checking, state machine management,
          and other high-level services, relieving the OpenVMS application pro-
          grammer of tedious protocol details such as state machine processing
          or "standard" SNA message format checking. The interface appears to
          the OpenVMS application as a set of subroutines that it calls to re-
          quest the following operations:

          o  Establish an SNA session with an application running on an IBM host

          o  Respond to a session request initiated by an IBM application

          o  Reestablish a session if the connection is broken

          o  Disconnect from a session

          o  Receive messages from an IBM host on the normal or expedited flow

          o  Send messages to an IBM host on the normal or expedited flow

                                           2

          Interface for OpenVMS, Version 2.5

          o  Provide positive or negative responses to messages transmitted from
             an IBM host


          Asynchronous Event Notification

          API provides a mechanism for an OpenVMS user application to receive
          control when an asynchronous "network event" occurs, such as the dis-
          connection of a DECnet logical link, an SNA circuit failure, or the
          receipt of an Unbind Type 2 from IBM. The OpenVMS application is called
          at a notification entry point defined by the application at connec-
          tion time; an indication of the event that occurred is reported.

          SNA Functions

          API provides OpenVMS applications with access to the SNA functions per-
          formed by either an SNA gateway or SNA server. These include SNA path
          control functions, data link control functions, and upper-level func-
          tions such as checking access information. API provides assistance with
          some functions such as brackets and chaining. In addition, API sup-
          ports negotiable binds and handles exception responses for the user
          application. For complete details about which SNA functions are pro-
          vided by this product, refer to the product documentation.

          The application must provide the remaining SNA functions it requires.
          For example, the application must be designed to:

          o  Process all FMD layer protocols

          o  Take into account all data flow control and session control request/response
             units

          o  Keep track of any "states" relevant to the application

          o  Translate between ASCII and EBCDIC, and vice versa

          o  Parse the bind request

          o  Respond to request units

          Interface for OpenVMS, Version 2.5

          User Interface

          Users of API should be experienced OpenVMS application programmers.
          They can use any of the OpenVMS programming languages that conform to
          the OpenVMS Calling Standard to create application programs that in-
          teract with application programs on an IBM system. The user documen-
          tation provides example programs written in the following languages:

          o  MACRO-32

          o  ADA

          o  BASIC

          o  BLISS

          o  C

          o  COBOL

          o  FORTRAN

          o  PASCAL

          o  PL/I

          Users of this product should be familiar with SNA and have some knowl-
          edge of the type of logical unit that will be used.

          INSTALLATION

          Installation services from Compaq are recommended for a customer's first
          purchase of this software product. These services provide for instal-
