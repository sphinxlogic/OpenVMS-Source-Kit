          PRODUCT NAME:  Compaq DECnet[TM] SNA Gateway for Channel Transport, SPD
          29.76.06                Version 2.2

          DESCRIPTION

          Compaq DECnet SNA Gateway for Channel Transport (DECnet SNA Gateway-
          CT) is a member of the DECnet SNA Transport product family. This fam-
          ily consists of hardware and software products that allow users to ex-
          change information and share resources between suitably configured Com-
          paq systems in a DECnet environment and IBM systems in a Systems Net-
          work Architecture (SNA) environment.

          Users on one or more Compaq systems can simultaneously perform func-
          tions such as accessing IBM application programs or other system re-
          sources, act as a 3270 display station, perform data transfer between
          Compaq and IBM file systems, exchange electronic documents and mail
          messages, submit jobs to IBM batch subsystems acting as a Remote Job
          Entry workstation, and implement distributed, task-to-task applica-
          tion programs that run between Compaq and IBM systems.

          The DECnet SNA Transport product set provides a means of connecting
          DECnet and SNA networks that can be used by a wide variety of Compaq-
          supplied access routines running on OpenVMS Alpha, OpenVMS VAX, and
          Tru64 UNIX operating environments. The Gateway-CT is managed and con-
          figured using the DECnet SNA gateway management software that is part
          of Compaq DECnet SNA Gateway-CT. For additional information on the var-
          ious access routines and their capabilities, see the Optional Soft-
          ware section of this Software Product Description.

          Compaq DECnet SNA Gateway-CT is part of both the DECnet and the SNA
          networks. Architecturally, it is a DECnet Phase IV end node implemen-
          tation to DECnet and a Physical Unit (PU) Type 2.0 node to SNA. It pro-
          vides bidirectional access between DECnet and SNA networks.

                                                                   April 2001

 



          Compaq DECnet[TM] SNA Gateway for Channel Transport,  SPD 29.76.06
          Version 2.2

          The DECnet SNA Gateway-CT software is supported on two hardware plat-
          forms: the DEC ChannelServer (DESNA-Ax) and DEC ChannelServer II (DESNB-
          Ax). Both systems connect directly to an Ethernet local area network
          (LAN) and an IBM S/370 Byte Multiplexor, Block Multiplexor, or Selec-
          tor channel. When used with DECnet SNA Gateway-CT, both systems pro-
          vide SNA connectivity to any DECnet system in a DECnet network.

          Note: In this document, the term "DEC ChannelServer" refers to either
          hardware device. The DEC ChannelServer hardware devices are no longer
          available from Compaq, but are still supported. For details, please
          contact your local Compaq representative.

          This product can be used in networks currently using other DECnet SNA
          Gateway systems and can share access routines, Ethernet LANs, and load
          host resources with those systems.

          Compaq DECnet SNA Gateway-CT software is downline loaded into the DEC
          ChannelServer or DEC ChannelServer II system. The gateway management
          software, which is part of Compaq DECnet SNA Gateway-CT, is required
          for the OpenVMS node desiganted as the load host for Compaq DECnet SNA
          Gateway-CT. Other DECnet systems wishing access to the SNA environ-
          ment through the DEC ChannelServer or DEC ChannelServer II should be
          configured with the appropriate DECnet SNA access routine(s).

          Compaq DECnet SNA Gateway-CT and the DEC ChannelServer support a sin-
          gle set of Bus and Tag connectors to an IBM S/370 Byte Multiplexor,
          Block Multiplexor, or Selector channel. The channel type and address
          may be configured according to specifications listed in both the hard-
          ware and software user documentation.

          Loading Compaq DECnet SNA Gateway-CT Software

          The DEC ChannelServer requires software to be loaded into memory be-
          fore DECnet SNA Gateway operation. Compaq DECnet SNA Gateway-CT soft-
          ware is downline loaded into the hardware across the Ethernet LAN from
          an OpenVMS Alpha or OpenVMS VAX system acting as a DECnet load host
          system.

          Compaq DECnet[TM] SNA Gateway for Channel Transport,  SPD 29.76.06
          Version 2.2

          Most Alpha and VAX systems running OpenVMS software are supported as
          Ethernet load hosts for Compaq DECnet SNA Gateway-CT. Supported Open-
          VMS configurations are described in the OpenVMS Operating System for
          Alpha and VAX Software Product Description (SPD 25.01.xx).

          DECnet SNA Gateway Management Software

          DECnet SNA gateway management software, which is part of the DECnet
          SNA Gateway-CT, provides configuration and management functions for
          use with Compaq DECnet SNA Gateway for Channel Transport. This man-
          agement software allows the gateway administrator to configure the soft-
          ware executing in the DECnet SNA Gateway-CT system. The administra-
          tor can set up parameters relating to lines, circuits, physical units,
          logical units, and other key variables necessary for network-to-network
          communications between the DECnet and SNA networks. In addition, the
          software allows the administrator to manage and diagnose problems re-
          lated to the Compaq DECnet SNA Gateway-CT.

          DECnet SNA gateway management software is required on the Compaq load
          host node for Compaq DECnet SNA Gateway-CT. It must also be present
          on any other OpenVMS node where users want to manage a Compaq DECnet
          SNA Gateway-CT and the DEC ChannelServer. It is strongly recommended
          that the software also be installed on OpenVMS systems in order to fa-
          cilitate debugging functions where IBM Interconnect application pro-
          grams are developed using any of the DECnet SNA Programming Interface
          products.

          Gateway management software includes DECnet style network management
          tools for configuring, controlling, monitoring, and troubleshooting
          the DECnet SNA Gateway product. These activities are generally per-
          formed by the Compaq system manager responsible for the designated load
          host node. Most management functions are performed from a node on the
          Compaq network rather than at or on the Gateway itself.

          Management of the DECnet SNA Gateway should be viewed as part of the
          Compaq environment, while management of the lines and/or channel con-
          necting the DECnet SNA Gateway to the IBM system is a joint respon-
          sibility of the IBM and Compaq system managers.

          Compaq DECnet[TM] SNA Gateway for Channel Transport,  SPD 29.76.06
          Version 2.2

          DECnet SNA gateway management software allows a Compaq system oper-
          ator to bootstrap or restart a DECnet SNA Gateway remotely and pro-
          vide configuration and initialization facilities for the DECnet SNA
          Gateway.

          Problem Isolation and Determination Tools for the Gateway

          In addition to event logging and error counters, a wide range of fault
          isolation tools are included.

          Trace capabilities SNATRACE and NETTRACE for OpenVMS are provided with
          Compaq DECnet SNA Gateway-CT to help debug application programs as well
          as assist in identifying system problems. An operator can run a trace
          at the Circuit, Physical Unit (PU), or Session level, and then for-
          mat the data on a specified Compaq system. The trace features are help-
          ful in identifying an error for remedial action.

          A snapshot monitoring utility is provided to display on a Compaq host-
          controlled terminal the status of the Gateway's buffer availability,
          the number of SNA sessions currently in progress, and other informa-
          tion that pertains to both the DECnet and SNA networks.

          If an irrecoverable error should occur during operation of the DEC-
          net SNA Gateway system, a memory image may be dumped to a designated
          Ethernet attached Alpha or VAX host. This memory image may then be pro-
          vided to your Compaq support personnel for problem diagnosis.

          INSTALLATION

          Installation services from Compaq are recommended for a customer's first
          purchase of this software product. These services provide for instal-
          lation of the software by an experienced Compaq installation special-
          ist.
