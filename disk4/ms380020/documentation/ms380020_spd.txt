 PRODUCT NAME:  MUXserver 320/380/90 Remote Terminal Server,     SPD
 32.94.03                Version 2.0

 DESCRIPTION

 The MUXserver 320/380/90 Remote Terminal Server is a wide area ter-
 minal switch for Ethernet Local Area Networks. It has been designed
 to support interactive asynchronous terminal users, using data com-
 pression, background priority, and statistical multiplexing to opti-
 mize the network performance.

 When used in conjunction with a DECmux 300, the MUXserver 320/380/90
 provides concurrent Local Area Transport (LAT) and Internet (Telnet
 /TCP/IP) support to enable connectivity to host systems that utilize
 LAT or Internet protocols. The Internet protocol suite is used to con-
 nect to UNIX[R] host systems and other host systems that support the
 Internet protocol suite. In general, the MUXserver 320/380/90/DECmux
 300 provides the same terminal services to a remote workgroup as the
 DECserver products give to local users.

 MUXserver 320/380/90 features include:

 o  LAT protocol

 o  Internet protocols (Telnet/TCP/IP)

 o  Statistical multiplexing and data compression

 o  Background transfer ports

 o  Optimized for remote echo terminals

 Features

 Terminal Connection Management

 Through the use of a simple command, users can establish a logical con-
 nection, called a session, to any LAT service node on the same Eth-
 ernet LAN or to any Internet host on the same Ethernet LAN or via an
 Internet gateway. This connection makes the terminal appear as if it
 were physically connected to the LAT service node or Internet host,
 and the terminal user can use standard system utilities and applica-
 tions supported by that system. Each terminal connected to the DEC-
 mux 300 remote terminal multiplexer can connect to the same or a dif-
 ferent LAT service node or Internet host.

 Multiple Sessions

 The MUXserver 320/380/90 allows each user to establish and maintain
 up to eight sessions to one or more service nodes or Internet hosts,
 up to a maximum of 128 sessions per MUXserver 320, 384 sessions per
 MUXserver 90, and 512 sessions per MUXserver 380. Only one session per
 user can be active at a time. Through simple switching commands, the
 user can access the different sessions without repeating a login di-
 alogue each time. Some operating systems may impose limits on the num-
 ber of LAT or Telnet sessions such a host will support.

 Session Management Terminals

 The MUXserver 320/380/90 allows direct communication with devices that
 support the Terminal Device/Session Management Protocol (TD/SMP) pro-
 tocol. This protocol provides the ability for the attached device to
 maintain screen and keyboard context for multiple LAT sessions.

 Remote Access Sessions

 The MUXserver 320/380/90 allows sessions to be established by remote
 LAT service nodes or Internet hosts to asynchronous devices. Such re-
 mote access sessions are useful for printers and asynchronous ASCII
 hosts.

 Access Contention

                                  3

 

 Fully configured MUXservers can provide the following connections:

 ___________________________________________________________________
                 Device- Active-

  90      3       96      96    384

 320      6      192      32    128

 380_____16______512_____128____512_________________________________

 MUXservers provide access to users on a first-come-first-served ba-
 sis. The MUXserver 90 will provide access to 96 users. Permanent log-
 ical connections can be assigned to specific ports to ensure access
 at all times. When a logical connection is not available, a status mes-
 sage is relayed to the port requiring access.

 Data Transparency

 Data is normally passed transparently between the port on the DECmux
 300 and the current session's associated LAT service node or Inter-
 net host. Exceptions to this are:

 o  If XON/XOFF flow control is specified for the port, these charac-
    ters are interpreted by the DECmux 300.

 o  Certain characters can be specified as session switch characters.
    When these are input from the port, they are interpreted by the MUXserver
    320/380/90 and not passed to the LAT service node or Internet host.

 o  When using Telnet, certain characters can be specified as invok-
    ing certain Telnet functions. When these are input from the port,
    they are interpreted by the MUXserver 320/380/90 and not passed to
    the Internet host.

 The data transparency can be controlled on a session-by-session ba-
 sis:

 o  Session switch characters can be disabled and thus passed to the
    LAT service node or Internet host. For LAT sessions, that is re-
    ferred to as pass-through mode and can be controlled by the port

                                  4

 

    user or the LAT service node. For Telnet, switch characters are dis-
    abled if the session is in binary mode, which can be controlled by
    the port user or the Internet host. This is appropriate for ASCII
    file transfers from/to personal computers.

 o  XON/XOFF flow control characters can be disabled. For LAT sessions,
    that is referred to as pass-all mode and can be controlled by the
    port user or the LAT service node. For Telnet, XON/XOFF characters
    are disabled if the session is in binary mode, which can be con-
    trolled by the port user or the Internet host. This is appropri-
    ate for binary data file transfers from/to personal computers.

 o  Telnet request characters can be disabled at the request of the port
    user. They are also disabled if the Telnet session is in binary mode,
    which can be controlled by the port user or the Internet host.

 Network Configurations

 The MUXserver 320/380/90 network is built from two basic options: the
 MUXserver 320/380/90, which connects to the Ethernet, and the remote
 unit. Supported remote units are the DECmux 308, 316, and 332.

 Synchronous Links

 Each MUXserver 90 can support one synchronous communications line and
 support up to three DECmux 300s.

 Each MUXserver 320 can support up to two synchronous communications
 lines, and each line can support up to three DECmux 300s.

 The total aggregate bandwidth supported over the two synchronous links
 is 82.2K bps. This equates to one link operating at 64K bps and an-
 other link operating at 19.2K bps.

 Each MUXserver 380 can support up to eight synchronous communications
 lines, and each line can support up to three DECmux 300s. However the
 maximum number of DECmux 300s that can be connected is limited to six-
 teen and the maximum aggregate synchronous link bandwidth is 128K bps
 full duplex.

                                  5

 

 The MUXserver 320/380/90 synchronous links use LAPB data link proto-
 col and can be connected using the following physical link options.
 Network configuration, link types, and link speeds are automatically
 configured when the correct cables are used.

 o  EIA 232-D/CCITT V.28 at 2.4K, up to 19.2K bits per second

 o  CCITT X.21 bis/CCITT V.35 at 48K, up to 64K bits per second

 o  EIA RS-449/CCITT V.36, up to 64K bits per second

 o  CCITT X.21, leased line data leads only, up to 64K bits per sec-
    ond

 o  EIA RS-422, up to 64K bits per second

 The MUXserver 320/380/90 EIA RS-422 synchronous link can be used to
 connect two units. Clocking signals are supplied by the MUXserver. Dis-
 tances up to 1,200 meters or 4,000 feet are supported on suitable ca-
 ble installations.

 The MUXserver 320/380/90 network is designed to operate over wide area
 network links that provide no significant delay and a transparent data
 path. Synchronous composite links operating over multiplexing equip-
 ment or satellite links are not supported.

 Ethernet LAN Interconnect

 The MUXserver 320/380/90 provides both ThinWire and standard Thick-
 wire Ethernet V2.0/IEEE 802.3 ports. Selection is by an accessible push-
 button switch.

 DECmux 308/316/332

 The DECmux 300 requires a synchronous connection to a MUXserver 320
 /380/90 for proper operation.

 The DECmux units are available in the following configurations:

 o  Eight EIA 232-D/CCITT V.24 ports with modem control (DECmux 308)

 o  Sixteen EIA 232-D/CCITT V.24 ports with modem control (DECmux 316)

 o  Sixteen DEC423 ports, data leads only (DECmux 316-B)

                                  6

 

 o  Thirty-two DEC423 ports, data leads only (DECmux 332)

 The eight- and sixteen-port units are field upgradable using the fol-
 lowing upgrade panels kits. After installation, the new configuration
 is automatically reconfigured and the DECmux is initialized to fac-
 tory default settings.

 o  Eight EIA 232-D/CCITT V.24 ports with modem control

 o  Sixteen DEC423 ports, data leads only

 The DECmux 300 EIA 232-D ports are compatible with Digital Equipment
 Corporation's family of modems and with Bell 100- and 200-series modems
 and their equivalents.

 MUXserver 300 Compatibility

 DECmux 300s previously used with a MUXserver 300 can be migrated to
 a MUXserver 380 without change. DECmux 300s used with a MUXserver 320
 /380/90 can be returned to use with a MUXserver 300, but some config-
 uration information will not be used by the MUXserver 300.

 Asynchronous Device Support

 The MUXserver 320/380/90 software supports the simultaneous operation
 of asynchronous devices at speeds from 75 bps to 19.2K bps. The soft-
 ware also supports:

 o  Full modem control support (on DECmux 300 EIA 232-D ports only)

 o  Data leads only support (on DECmux 300 EIA 232-D and DEC423 ports)

 o  XON/XOFF flow control, except when session transparency prevents
    its use

 o  CTS/RTS or DSR/DTR flow control (on DECmux 300 EIA 232-D ports only)

 o  Split speed (transmit and receive) terminal operation

 o  Modem fallback features (on DECmux 300 EIA 232-D ports only)

 o  Automatic line speed detection (equal receive and transmit speed
    only)

                                  7

 

 o  Ability to pass break character and error notification

 o  Ability to assist in multiple session management via TD/SMP

 Port Access

 A port on a DECmux 300 connected to a MUXserver 320/380/90 can be set
 up in different ways depending on the device attached to the port and
 its intended use.

 o  Access Local-Designed for interactive terminals. This allows the
    device (typically an interactive terminal) attached to the port to
    CONNECT to LAT services. This type of access is also used for dial-
    in modems.

 o  Access Remote-Designed for applications-driven devices such as asyn-
    chronous printers that are allocated by a service node process. This
    allows the implementation of certain shared printers by multiple
    service nodes. This type of access is also used for connections to
    dial-out modems and Asynchronous ASCII host systems.

 o  Access Dynamic-Designed for devices (such as personal computers or
    printers with keyboards) that require both Local and Remote access.

 o  Access None-Designed to allow the server manager to disable the use
    of a port.

 Asynchronous Printer Support

 The MUXserver 320/380/90 and DECmux 300 can be used to provide log-
 ical connections to printers that are asynchronous devices as previ-
 ously described. Access is possible both from LAT service nodes and
 Internet hosts. Printers that support XON/XOFF, ASCII standards, and
 EIA 232D/CCITT V.24/V.28 interfaces can be connected to the DECmux 300.
 It is strongly recommended that printers supporting modem control sig-
 nals be used, in which case connections will not be established to print-
 ers where modem control signals are not present, e.g., the printer is
 switched off.

 The server manager can associate a LAT service name or a Telnet Lis-
 tener with individual ports or groups of ports that connect to a printer(s).
 Alternatively, using the LAT protocol, a service node can request a
 connection to a named port that connects to a printer.

 Asynchronous ASCII Host Support

                                  9

 

 The MUXserver 320/380/90 and DECmux 300 can be used to provide log-
 ical terminal connections to hosts that do not implement the LAT or
 Internet protocols. In this type of configuration, the server becomes
 the Ethernet connection and protocol support for these hosts. This ex-
 pands the network accessibility to include hosts directly connected
 to the same Ethernet as the MUXserver and hosts connected via a DEC-
 server terminal server port.

 A host that supports XON/XOFF, ASCII standards, and EIA 232-D/CCITT
 V.24/V.28 interfaces can be connected to the DECmux 300. This provides
 the terminal user with a transparent connection to the host. It is strongly
 recommended that server port and host side port utilize modem control
 signals to signal the host automatically upon session disconnection.

 In this configuration, there is a one-to-one correspondence between
 the port on a DECmux 300 and the connection on the host. The server
 manager can associate the LAT service name or Telnet Listener with in-
 dividual ports or groups of ports that connect the host interface to
 the server.

 LAT Protocol

 The MUXserver 320/380/90 uses the Digital Local Area Transport (LAT
 V5.2) protocol to communicate with hosts on the same Ethernet. This
 protocol is specially optimized for remote echo terminal traffic over
 a LAN.

 Services

 A LAT service node can have one or more services that are offered to
 MUXserver 320/380/90 network users. Services and nodes are identified
 by name. Users always connect to services, not to nodes, although of-
 ten one of the service names will be the node name.

 In a VAXcluster environment, the MUXserver 320/380/90 sees each VAX-
 cluster on the Ethernet as a collection of LAT service nodes offer-
 ing a common service. Each cluster node can also offer a service whose
 name is equivalent to its node name. In this case, a terminal user can
 connect either to the cluster service or a service associated with a
 particular cluster node.

                                 10

 

 Load Balancing

 When a connection is made to a LAT service, the actual node for the
 connection is determined by load balancing. Load balancing is the pro-
 cess the server uses when more than one node offers the same service.
 Service nodes do not have to be configured in a cluster in order for
 load balancing to be used. Service nodes with the same names can be
 running different operating systems. Using the load balancing process,
 the server connects to the node with the highest rating for the ser-
 vice desired. This rating is based on the current loading on the nodes
 that offer the service.

 Automatic Session Failover

 If a LAT service is available on two or more service nodes and a con-
 nection to a service fails, the server will attempt to connect the user
 to another service node offering the same service. The user's context
 at the time of failure is not automatically restored, and login to the
 new service is required. This feature is supported for LAT connections
 only.

 Groups

 Every terminal and service node in a LAT network is a member of one
 or more groups, which are specified by a list of numbers from 0 to 255.
 Groups allow an easy means of subdividing the network into what ap-
 pears to be many smaller networks. A terminal user is only aware of
 the services that are offered by nodes in the same group(s).

 The server manager can specify the authorized group(s) in which a ter-
 minal is a member. The authorized groups define the set of services
 the user is allowed to access. In addition, a user can further restrict
 access to services by disabling some of the authorized groups using
 a non-privileged group command. The user-settable group codes are a
 subset of the authorized groups.





                                 11

 

 Groups provide a restrictive view of the network. This restricted view
 is mainly for user convenience and, although it also provides a form
 of security, it is not intended to be the primary form of access au-
 thorization or system security for a node. Groups apply only to LAT
 connections.

 Outbound Connection Queues

 If a terminal user requests a connection to a service and the requested
 service is currently in use, the terminal server users can opt to have
 the connection requested queued to the remote service. This feature
 will happen automatically whenever a connection fails for this rea-
 son if the user's port has been appropriately configured and the ser-
 vice node is queuable. The connection request is queued at the ser-
 vice node end and is processed first-in/first-out until such time as
 the user's connection request can be completed. This feature assists
 in the fair management of limited network resources. Once queued for
 connection, the user also has the option to cancel the queue entry and
 proceed with other sessions.

 Local Services

 The MUXserver 320/380/90 can offer DECmux 300 ports as services. A named
 service can be associated with one or more DECmux 300 ports, either
 on the same or multiple DECmux 300s. The rating of the service reflects
 the proportion of ports currently available. If a request is received
 for a connection to a service and all ports associated with that ser-
 vice are being used, the MUXserver 320/380/90 can offer a queuing fa-
 cility for incoming connect requests, with connections being granted
 on a first-come-first-served basis.

 Internet Protocols (Telnet/TCP/IP)

 The Internet protocol suite was developed for use on the ARPANET and
 is specified by US Defense Data Network (DDN) Request for Comments (RFCs).
 The Internet protocols supported by the MUXserver 320/380/90 are:

 o  Internet Protocol (IP) - RFC 791

 o  Subnet Addressing - RFC 950

                                 12

 

 o  Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) - RFC 792

 o  Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) - RFC 826

 o  Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) - RFC 793

 o  User Datagram Protocol (UDP) - RFC 768 (used by Domain Name Ser-
    vices)

 o  Domain Name Services (DNS) - RFCs 1034, 1035, and 1101

 o  Telnet - RFC 854

 o  Telnet Options - RFCs 855 and 861

 The following Telnet options are supported:

 o  Status - RFC 859

 o  End of record - RFC 885

 o  Toggle flow control - RFC 1080

 o  Echo - RFC 857

 o  Timing mark - RFC 860

 o  Linemode - RFC 1116

 o  Binary - RFC 856

 o  Suppress go ahead - RFCs 854 and 858

 o  Terminal type - RFC 1091

 Telnet Client

 Telnet client provides the ability to connect to any remote TCP port
 at an Internet address on a local area network (LAN) or a wide area
 network (WAN). Telnet client allows the user to specify a remote com-
 puter by Internet address as well as by domain name. The MUXserver 320
 /380/90 maintains a translation table of domain names containing ei-
 ther or both domain names entered by the server manager or learned from
 Domain Name Servers on the Internet.

                                 13

 

 The port user can control characteristics of a Telnet session on a session-
 by-session basis. Profiles provide quick access to standard charac-
 teristics. Telnet character, line, and binary profiles are supported.





































                                 14

 

 Telnet Server

 Telnet server provides the ability to accept connection requests from
 Internet hosts to MUXserver 320/380/90 ports with attached asynchronous
 devices such as printers or host systems. One or more ports can be as-
 sociated with a particular Telnet Listener port number. Ports can be
 associated with both Telnet Listeners and with LAT local services. Al-
 ternatively, a LAT service name can be associated with a Telnet Lis-
 tener port number, in which case a connection to that Telnet Listener
 port number will be interpreted as a connection to the specified LAT
 service. Queuing of connection requests is not supported via Telnet.

 User Interface

 Welcome Identification

 The MUXserver 320/380/90 server standard welcome banner, which includes
 terminal server type, version number, internal baselevel, and proto-
 col version number, is issued whenever a user successfully logs in to
 the server. The server will also print a server-manager settable iden-
 tification string. This can be useful for automatic server identifi-
 cation or for small daily messages used for communication with the ter-
 minal server users.

 Local Mode and Service Mode

 For the most part, the environment provided by the MUXserver/DECmux
 300 is identical to that the user would experience if attached directly
 to the service node. When operating in this mode, the user is said to
 be in service mode. Occasionally, such as during connection establish-
 ment, the user interacts directly with the MUXserver/DECmux 300. When
 operating in this mode, the user is in local mode.

 In local mode, the terminal input is interpreted directly by MUXserver
 /DECmux 300 as commands to be performed by the server. The default prompt
 can be set by the manager.




                                 15

 

 In service mode, the terminal input is passed directly to the connected
 service node or Internet host with several exceptions. One exception,
 called the local switch character, allows the user to enter local mode
 from service mode. The BREAK key can also be used for this function.

 Other exceptions, called the forward and backward switch characters,
 allow the user to switch between sessions without the need to enter
 local mode. The switch characters are disabled by default but can be
 enabled by command. Both CTRL/S and CTRL/Q are normally interpreted
 locally, but flow control using these characters can be disabled.

 Autoconnection

 Autoconnection is a function that automatically connects a user ter-
 minal to a service node when connection failures occur or upon user
 login to the server. In conjunction with this function, a dedicated
 or preferred service can be specified for each terminal user.

 If a dedicated service is specified, the MUXserver 320/380/90 will at-
 tempt to connect to that service when a character is typed on the ter-
 minal keyboard or when an existing connection fails. In dedicated ser-
 vice mode, only one session is available. As this mode is designed to
 simulate a direct terminal connection, no local mode commands or mes-
 sages are available to the terminal user. Ports with dedicated ser-
 vice can be logged out of the server automatically when the user logs
 out of the service node.

 If a preferred service is specified, the MUXserver 320/380/90 will at-
 tempt to connect to that service as with the dedicated service mode
 of operation. However, the terminal user can enter local mode and es-
 tablish other sessions.

 Online HELP Facility

 A full online reference HELP facility is available. The server's HELP
 command provides information on the correct syntax and details about
 each command. In addition, a tutorial HELP feature allows new users
 to learn quickly the basics of MUXserver 320/380/90 operation. Tuto-
 rial HELP can be entered upon logging in to the server.

                                 16

 

 Directory Service

 Any MUXserver 320/380/90 user can obtain a directory of LAT services
 available to that user with a SHOW SERVICES command. Services for which
 the user's port is not authorized will not be displayed. Services ap-
 ply only to LAT connections. The domain names of known Internet hosts
 can also be obtained using a SHOW Internet HOST command.

 Security

 The MUXserver 320/380/90 provides functions that enhance security fea-
 tures already available in the service nodes. These functions can be
 enabled as required by the server manager.

 o  Port login password.

 o  Port lock password. This allows the user to leave sessions running
    at the terminal without fear of security violations. When a ter-
    minal is locked, all input from the terminal is ignored until the
    lock password is re-entered.

 o  Secure Port allows a user to change only dynamic settings on that
    port.

 o  Nonprivileged User can change dynamic and permanent settings on that
    port.

 o  Privileged User can change all settings. This mode is password pro-
    tected.

 o  Access to a local service can require a specified password to be
    supplied.

 o  Certain port users can be restricted from viewing available ser-
    vices (Limited View).

 o  Certain ports can be prevented from having their physical settings
    altered by a remote LAT service node or Internet host (Remote Mod-
    ification).

 Server Management

                                 17

 

 The principle means of managing the MUXserver 320/380/90 is by using
 the local mode commands accessible via any Local or Dynamic access port,
 the console port, or a remote management facility. Alternatively, SNMP
 can be used.

 Console Port

 The MUXserver 320/380/90 console port can accept directly connected
 asynchronous terminals with the following characteristics:

 o  DEC423 asynchronous start/stop transmission, having 8 data bits,
    1 start bit, 1 stop bit, and no parity

 o  Full duplex with XON/XOFF flow control

 o  Speed selectable from one of the following baud rates: 300, 600,
    1,200, 2,400, 4,800, 9,600, or AUTOBAUD

 Remote Server Management

 The MUXserver 320/380/90 implements the console carrier feature, which
 enables access to local mode from a Phase IV or Phase V DECnet host
 on the same LAN. With the exception of remote console port configu-
 ration, the entire local mode user interface is accessible to the re-
 mote console carrier user. This includes the privileged commands if
 the user knows the server's privileged password. This capability al-
 lows centralized server management and remote server diagnosis.

 The MUXserver 320/380/90 also enables access to local mode using the
 LAT or Telnet protocols. These capabilities allow centralized server
 management from another terminal server or from an Internet host.

 Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)

 The Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) agent allows the MUXserver
 320/380/90 and the DECmux 300 to be managed by an SNMP network man-
 agement system. Retrieving information from the terminal server is pos-
 sible using the SNMP GET and GET-NEXT requests. The SNMP SET opera-
 tion is fully supported, providing the ability to modify MUXserver pa-
 rameters as well as create and delete applicable table entries. The
 terminal server can send unsolicited event alarms to specified SNMP

                                 18

 

 management stations via the SNMP TRAP message. Terminal server vari-
 ables accessible via SNMP (RFC1157), are defined by the following Internet
 documents: MIB II (RFC 1213), RS232-like MIB (RFC 1317), the Charac-
 ter MIB (RFC 1316), the LAPB MIB (RFC 1381), and the DECmux MIB (Pri-
 vate).

 Server Characteristics

 The Server Manager in privileged mode can set up server identifica-
 tion information, change port characteristics, or fine tune the op-
 erating characteristics of the server. The Server Manager can also as-
 sign service names to groups of one or more ports. Internet charac-
 teristics such as Internet address and subnet mask can be modified and
 displayed.

 The MUXserver 320/380/90 and DECmux 300 maintain permanent character-
 istics in non-volatile memory, which are retained even when the power
 is disconnected. Permanent characteristics are maintained for service
 and server parameters as well as per-port parameters. Permanent char-
 acteristics can be reset to factory defaults by pressing the reset but-
 ton on the hardware unit while plugging in the power cord.

 Characteristics governing the operation of an individual port can be
 displayed by a nonprivileged terminal user interactively from their
 terminal. Many of the characteristics can be set up by the user, but
 certain characteristics are privileged and can only be changed by the
 Server Manager.

 Port parameters that can be set and displayed include speed, charac-
 ter size, group codes, parity, terminal type, access, autobaud, mo-
 dem, and password protection.

 Troubleshooting

 A privileged user can diagnose Ethernet communications problems by loop-
 ing messages to an Ethernet host and through the Ethernet hardware in-
 terface at the server. To diagnose terminal problems, users can ex-
 ecute a command to transmit test data to their terminal, or the server
 manager can send test data to any terminal. A privileged user can also

                                 19

 

 diagnose synchronous line problems by looping test messages between
 adjacent MUXserver 320/380/90 and DECmux 300 units.

 The capability also exists for the server manager to test a service
 connection by sending data to the service node and back again. At the
 service node, the data can be looped back by the LAT protocol, or in-
 ternally or externally at the service port. Not all LAT implementa-
 tions support this facility.

 The server maintains a variety of statistics and counters. These in-
 clude the following: synchronous data link statistics, Ethernet data
 link statistics, LAT protocol statistics, and port error statistics.
 This data can be displayed and zeroed by the Server Manager.

 Internet statistics are also maintained by the server. TCP, IP, ICMP,
 UDP, and SNMP protocol statistics can be displayed.

 Multiplexing

 Data to/from DECmux ports is multiplexed over the synchronous link or
 links between the MUXserver 320/380/90 and the DECmux 300. Reliable
 communication is achieved using the industry-standard LAPB protocol.
 Channels are statistically multiplexed so the available link capac-
 ity is shared fairly among active ports. Idle ports do not use any link
 capacity.

 Data Compression

 Data compression is automatically enabled and disabled on a per-port
 basis. It is dependent on the type of data being transmitted and only
 effective on blocks of data. Data compression is automatically deac-
 tivated when the synchronous link is operating above 19.2 kbps. Data
 compression efficiency will vary with the application.

 Background Priority

 Background priority can be specified by the server manager on a per-
 port basis. Traffic to and from ports set to background is reduced in
 favor of other traffic. This feature is especially useful for ports
 that are used for printers.

                                 20

 

 Operational Software

 The MUXserver 320/380/90 ROM-based firmware provides the necessary main-
 tenance operation protocols for downline loading operational software
 from a DECnet Phase IV or Phase V load host, over the Ethernet, into
 server memory. Alternatively, the firmware can perform downline load-
 ing using BOOTP/TFTP from an OSF/1[R] load host. All self-test diag-
 nostics are in MUXserver ROM; downline loading is not a precondition
 for MUXserver self-test. Once the MUXserver 320/380/90 downline load
 is complete, the network will self configure and communications will
 be established with the remote DECmux 300.

 In the event of a bugcheck caused by a fatal error, the unit will nor-
 mally attempt to upline dump server memory to a DECnet Phase IV or Phase
 V host. Following this, the unit will automatically initialize itself,
 execute the self test routines, and, if still operational, invoke a
 downline load.

 The remote DECmux 300 operates on ROM-based firmware. The remote DEC-
 mux 300 does not require downline loading but does require a connec-
 tion to a MUXserver 320/380/90 for operation.

 Performance

 The performance of a given MUXserver 320/380/90/DECmux 300 network de-
 pends on many factors, including:

 o  Synchronous link speed

 o  Number of route-through synchronous links

 o  Number of terminals

 o  Number of host systems with active connections to the server

 o  Terminal speeds

 o  Terminal user applications

 o  Number and size of host buffers

 o  Terminal workload

                                 21

 

 o  Host workload

 To achieve a viable configuration, the user and/or a Digital software
 specialist should perform a level of application analysis that addresses
 the factors above. The actual maximum data throughput cannot be cal-
 culated by multiplying the number of lines by the line speed, since
 many factors can reduce the actual throughput.

 Restrictions on MUXserver 320/380/90 Usage

 While terminal connections using the MUXserver/DECmux 300 have been
 designed to simulate direct terminal connections, a few differences
 exist because of the nature of the product. Under most circumstances,
 these differences are not noticed by terminal users or service node
 application programs. However, applications directly dependent on the
 following functions may not operate as with a direct connection:

 o  Setting the terminal speed, character size, and parity by manip-
    ulating system data structures

 o  Extremely fast response time (typically less than 200 ms) to op-
    erate

 o  Applications that utilize an alternate terminal driver in the ser-
    vice node

 o  Applications that expect incoming connections to have fixed device
    names
