          PRODUCT NAME:  Compaq SNA 3270 Terminal Emulator       SPD 26.84.10
                         for OpenVMS, Version 1.7

          This SPD describes Compaq SNA 3270 Terminal Emulator for OpenVMS, which
          is available for the OpenVMS VAX and OpenVMS Alpha platforms. All in-
          formation applies to both platforms unless otherwise indicated.

          DESCRIPTION

          The Compaq SNA 3270 Terminal Emulator for OpenVMS (3270 TE) is a lay-
          ered software product that allows users of a VT[TM]xxx terminal (or
          other terminal or personal computer in VT100, VT200, or VT300 mode)
          on suitably configured OpenVMS systems within a DECnet or TCP/IP net-
          work to interactively access IBM[R] host-based applications. These ap-
          plications have been originally developed for IBM 3270 display sta-
          tions in a Systems Network Architecture (SNA) networking environment.
          Access to the IBM host-based applications system from OpenVMS systems
          is via one of the following SNA server or gateway products:
          TCP/IP or DECnet connections

          o  Compaq SNA Peer Server

          o  Compaq SNA Domain Gateway

          o  Compaq SNA Access Server for Windows NT[R]

          o  Compaq SNA Server for OpenVMS Alpha, a layered product that sup-
             ports local access as well as TCP/IP and DECnet clients

          DECnet only connections

          o  Compaq DECnet SNA Gateway for Synchronous Transport

          o  Compaq DECnet Gateway for Channel Support

                                                                   April 2001

 



          Compaq SNA 3270 Terminal Emulator                     SPD 26.84.10
          for OpenVMS, Version 1.7

          o  Compaq SNA Server for OpenVMS VAX, an OpenVMS VAX layered product
             that supports local access as well as remote DECnet clients

          In normal operation, an IBM system transfers a formatted screen, much
          like a "form," to the 3270 block mode terminal, and the user fills in
          any data required by the form. The completed form is sent to the IBM
          host as a single unit. This mechanism is emulated with a character mode
          terminal by buffering the form in the host's memory and displaying it
          on the terminal. When the screen form is complete, it is sent to the
          IBM host system via the SNA server or gateway product.

          Translation tables on the respective systems convert ASCII terminal
          input (either Digital Multinational Character Set or National Replace-
          ment Character Set) to a subset of IBM multinational EBCDIC code for
          transfer through the SNA server or gateway product. These translation
          tables may be modified to fit nonstandard character sets.

          Users invoke the 3270 utility using the local OpenVMS system's com-
          mand language, including qualifiers to specify the target IBM system
          and system resources. While the emulation utility is operating, the
          terminal screen is formatted like a 3270 display. When the user has
          finished work on the IBM system, the 3270 emulator is dismissed and
          the terminal is "restored" as an OpenVMS command terminal.

          Features

          The 3270 Terminal Emulator supports emulation of the following fea-
          tures of an IBM 3270 display station when attached to an IBM 3274 1C
          controller with the following features:

          o  Category A terminal adapter (for 32 terminals)

          o  Configuration support D

          o  Common communications adapter

          o  External modem interface

          o  3270 TE allows, on supported SNA servers and gateways, secured LUs
             (Logical Units) to be accessed via a password.

          for OpenVMS, Version 1.7

          o  Field inherit keys

          o  Programmed symbol selection keys

          This product has been designed such that it can be used with most IBM
          applications; however, those applications written using features not
          supported by the emulator (for example, 3270 Extended Data Stream) must
          be modified.

          A readily available online help facility provides information on keys
          with altered 3270-oriented functions. The status line as implemented
          on an actual 3270 display is not supported, however much of the same
          information is reported on a special status line that may be overlaid
          on the VT200's twenty-fourth line. In addition, the OpenVMS system man-
          ager has the ability to remap certain IBM key functions onto differ-
          ent locations on the VT keyboard.

          INSTALLATION

          Only experienced customers should attempt installation of this prod-
          uct. Installation services from Compaq are recommended for all other
          customers. These services provide for installation of the software prod-
          uct by an experienced software specialist.

          PREREQUISITE SUPPORT

          For Compaq SNA 3270 Terminal Emulator for OpenVMS to be Compaq-supported,
          the customer must have a support agreement for the selected prepreq-
          uisite SNA server or gateway product.
